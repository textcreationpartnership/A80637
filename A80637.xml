         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Works of this Reverend Author (now with God) have already praiſed him in the gate. The name of <hi>Cotton</hi> is as an oyntment poured out; nor needs there more to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Book to any godly Readers acceptation, then to ſay, 'tis his. But as the name of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor puts a great value upon the Work, ſo the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter doth it much more. The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is a taking Title. How free is Grace! how ſure is the Covenant! The freeneſs of grace, and the ſureneſs of the Covenant of Grace, as made with Jeſus Christ for us, or with us in Jeſus Chriſt, is the Subject of this excellent Piece. That unbelievers may be inticed into the bonds of this Covenant, and believers grow up in the joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it, and that the unſearchable riches of grace, may be admired by all, are the reaſons of this Publication.</p>

               <p n="1">1. From the ſweet Communion which their Fathers had with God before either Temple
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170568:14"/>or Tabernacle was built: and if ſo, then he would not have them look at it as unſafe for them, or as an utter ruine to Religion, if that both the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Temple were deſtroyed in themſelves, and fulfilled in Him. Three paſſages of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> communion with God, <hi>Steven</hi> doth relate and maintain that he had them before any of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Cuſtomes were known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God did <hi>effectually call him;</hi> which call he did alſo obey, (2, 3, 4. ver.) though as yet he knew no Circumciſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God giveth him <hi>a trial of his Faith,</hi> wherein he found <hi>Abraham</hi> faithful, 5, 6, 7. verſes. God promiſed to give him the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for a Poſſeſſion, but he gave him not a foots breadth. He promiſed to give it unto his Seed, when as yet he had no childe: and when God gave him Seed, yet they ſhould ſojourn in a ſtrange Land, and be in Bondage four hundred years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God gave him the <hi>Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> in the words of the Text. And <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the ſtrength of the Bleſſing of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and circumciſed him according to Gods direction; and all this before <hi>Moſes</hi> gave any Ordinances unto them to keep; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either Temple, or Tabernacle was built. From hence we have heard, that the ſoul may have very ſpiritual and gracious communion with God, before it partake in any ſeal of Church-fellowſhip. For <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith was throughly tryed before he had the Seal of Church-Covenant given him. We heard alſo this propounded, which is the words of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170568:14"/>the Text, that <hi>God gave unto Abraham the Covenant of Circumciſion:</hi> which Doctrine doth imply in it four principal parts, all of them ſerving to clear <hi>Stevens</hi> meaning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of diſpenſing it: <hi>God gave,</hi> ſo it was by Gift.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Articles of it;</hi> and they are to be inquired into.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Confederates,</hi> and they are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; <hi>God</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed on the other ſide.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Seal</hi> of it, <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which was alſo the Seal of Church-Covenant. Theſe four parts do yeeld ſo many Notes; the firſt of them was ſpoken unto in the laſt point formerly handled. Now for the ſecond and third parts, (to wit, the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the <hi>Confederates</hi>) we comprehend them both in this one Note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in the Covenant which God made with</hi> Abraham, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>God gave himſelf to be a God to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and to his Seed; and received</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>and his Seed to be a People unto himſelf; and the chiefeſt of this ſeed, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he took to be the Mediator, or Surety of this Covenant between them both.</hi> This is the ſum of the Articles, and of the Confederates: what the Articles be, is not here mentioned; but Gen. 17.7. they be, (for to ſpeak of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion before the Covenant, it is but a ſeal to a blank) where the Lord expreſſeth himſelf thus, ſaying, <hi>I will stabliſh my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170568:15"/>As for other parts of the Covenant, they were more properly given unto himſelf, as to be <hi>exceeding fruitful,</hi> and to be the <hi>Father of many Nations, to inherit the land of Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. thoſe things were more peculiarly <hi>proper</hi> unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> though they have alſo a moral and univerſal uſe and force in all the Faithful, whom the Lord doth make fruitful, and giveth them a Nail in his Tabernacle. In the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant theſe three things are implied:</p>
               <p n="1">1. God gave himſelf to be <hi>a God</hi> unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed: this is ſuch an Argument as the ſtrength and wiſdome of men and angels cannot unfold: It is a Catechiſm-point, and by way of Catechiſm to be opened, (as the Lord hath revealed it) I mean, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and familiarly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 God did <hi>receive Abraham,</hi> and <hi>his Seed,</hi> to be <hi>his People:</hi> this is implyed, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily inferred by the rule of Relatives: for if God do give himſelf to be <hi>a God</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to <hi>his Seed,</hi> and doth not firſtly require it of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his Seed that they ſhould give up themſelves to <hi>be his People,</hi> then it muſt of neceſſity follow, that the Lord will undertake to receive them to be a People unto himſelf, and ſo he will perform both his own part of the Covenant, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> part alſo, according to what we read, Deut. 7.6, 7, 8. <hi>The Lord thy God hath choſen thee to be a special People unto himſelf: Not becauſe ye were in number more then any people, (for ye were the feweſt of all people: but becauſe he loved you, and would keep the Oath we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he had ſworn unto your fathers, therefore hath be brought you out with a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170568:15"/>mighty hand,</hi> &amp;c. when as they were in a land of Idols, and the Lord lifted up his hand to have deſtroyed them there; yet he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and wrought for his own Names ſake: So that though they were far off, yet the Lord (to make good his Covenant) brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſo from one Covenant to another: by all which things it doth appear, that the Lord will <hi>keep our part of the Covenant alſo;</hi> and this is neceſſarily implied, in that he promiſeth to be <hi>a God</hi> unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed, and there is <hi>no Reſtipulation</hi> on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part; we ſee this likewiſe held forth; Deut. 29.1. &amp; 13. where the Lord entereth into another Covenant with them in the land of <hi>Moab,</hi> beſides the Covenant which he made with them in <hi>Horeb;</hi> and in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he doth eſtabliſh them to be <hi>a People</hi> unto himſelf, as well as <hi>give himſelf</hi> unto them to be <hi>their God,</hi> ver. 13. And as God required it of them to circumciſe the outward man, even the foreskin of their children; ſo he will alſo circumciſe them, taking poſſeſſion of them, and circumciſing their hearts, taking away the ſtonineſs of them, and ſo fitting them to be a Temple for himſelf to dwell in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord in this Covenant taketh the chiefeſt of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, even the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be the Mediator</hi> and <hi>Surety</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and unto him do all the Promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; ſo the Apoſtle doth expound it, Gal. 3.16. <hi>Unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>and to his ſeed were the Promiſes made: He ſaith not, And to his ſeeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy ſeed; which is Chriſt.</hi> And ſo by him are all the Promiſes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170568:16"/>and Bleſſings of the Covenant conveyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, (his faithful ſeed) all the world over: and therefore he is called the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7.22. meaning the Covenant of Grace, Heb. 3.6. Theſe three things do contain the ſum of the Covenant of Grace, and of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and would therefore be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered unto Chriſtians: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is the meaning of this, that God <hi>gave himſelf</hi> unto <hi>Ahraham?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How doth he <hi>take Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, and make them <hi>his People?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. How doth he <hi>take Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and make him the <hi>ſurety</hi> of the Covenant between them both? For the Covenant is eſtabliſhed, and ſo is a firm, and ſure, and everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: Now in this gift, that God gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Obſerve 3. things,

               <p n="1">1. That God doth give himſelf, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> the whole <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of God, and all the <hi>Perſons</hi> of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, with all the <hi>Attributes</hi> of that Nature, and all the <hi>Offices</hi> of thoſe Perſons: For it is not a confuſed God, that vaniſheth away in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

If therefore the Lord God the <hi>Father</hi> give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will not be wanting to <hi>draw</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto the Son, Joh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him:</hi> And what is the chief buſineſs, and work that the Son hath to do about us?

And if it be the work of the Spirit of God to eſtabliſh us both in the Father and the Son, then will he <hi>convince the world of Sin, of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and of Judgment,</hi> Joh. 16.8. to 11. and ſo will ſtabliſh our hearts in the Comforts of the Lord our God; and this is that which the Apoſtle prayeth for the Epheſians, chap. 3.16. <hi>That the Lord would grant unto them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthned with might by his spirit in the inner man:</hi> and hence it cometh to paſſe, that what the Lord would have us to do, he is preſent by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to teach us, and to ſtrengthen us, and ſo to do it for us: All theſe things doth the Lord work for <hi>Abraham,</hi> and for his ſeed; ſo that look what is meet for a Father to do, or for a Brother to do, or for the Spirit of God to do, that will the Lord do unto his elect ones; and ſo he giveth all his <hi>Attributes,</hi> and they are even God himſelf; and therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee his Glory (and he deſired it from the Grace that God had ſhewed him) Exod. 34.6. the Lord proclaimed his Name before him, <hi>Jehovah, Jehovah, ſtrong, merciful, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, long-ſuffering and abundant in goodneſs and truth:</hi> thus doth the Lord give himſelf, and all the <hi>Perſons</hi> in the Godhead (as they are called) and <hi>Attributes,</hi> they are no more, nor other then <hi>God himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And as God himſelf is implyed; ſo when God is given by Covenant, all the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Creatures,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of God are given al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: For ſo it was in all Covenants of old time; when <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> maketh a Covenant with <hi>Ahab</hi> King of Iſrael, 2 King. 22.4. then, <hi>I am
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170568:17"/>as thou art, and my people as thy people, and my ho ſes as thy horſes,</hi> and all that he hath is for <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſervice; as the King goeth, ſo goeth his ſtrength: So thus it doth come to paſſe, that if the Lord of Hoſts be for us, and give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us, then alſo doth he give us his <hi>eternal Election,</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath wrought for the ſalvation of his Elect: <hi>He hath not ſo dealt with any Nation,</hi> (Pſal. 147.20.) but only with the Iſrael of God, unto them hath he given his <hi>Lawes,</hi> and ſhewed them his <hi>Judgments:</hi> And for his <hi>Creatures,</hi> they are all given to be <hi>for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to whom he hath given himſelf: If God be <hi>a God</hi> unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> then ſhall all Gods people be <hi>ſor</hi> him; <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> ſhall bleſſe him; <hi>Aner, Eſhchol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre</hi> ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates with him. The <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> ſhall fight in their courſes for the people of God; the <hi>Sea</hi> ſhall give way unto them, to paſſe through it on dry ground: <hi>What ailed you, ye ſtreams of Jordan, to go backward?</hi> Why, all the creatures of God muſt ſtoop unto the people of God, when he is in Covenant with them: this is that which the Lord promiſeth unto his people, Hoſ. 2.18. to 22. when the Lord ſhall marry them to him in faithfulneſs. <hi>In that day (ſaith the Lord) I will make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowls of the heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow, and the ſword, and the battel out of the earth, and I will make them to lie down ſafely. And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, I will hear the Heavens, and they ſhall hear the Earth, and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170568:18"/>earth ſhall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, and they ſhall hear Jezreel.</hi> Whether <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollo;</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>things preſent,</hi> or <hi>things to come, all are yours,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22. This is the large Gift of Gods Covenant: Nay, and (which is wonderful, and beyond all comprehenſion) when I ſay all the <hi>creatures</hi> and <hi>ordinances</hi> of God are ours, the very expreſſion of the phraſe doth imply that the Lord giveth himſelf to be the <hi>ſtaffe</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of them, ſo that you ſhall ſee the preſence of God in them; he will not only give a man Wife, and Children, and Ordinances, and Providences, but <hi>he himſelf</hi> will <hi>be</hi> in all theſe, and <hi>bleſſe</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the enjoyment of them all, ſo as that they ſhall <hi>enjoy God</hi> in all: Pſal. 16.5, 6. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.</hi> He ſaw the Lord in what he did enjoy; and when he had any thing, it was <hi>in God;</hi> and when he wanted any thing, it was ſupplied <hi>in</hi> him. The like did <hi>Jacob</hi> finde, when his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> came againſt him with 400. men, and the Lord turned him from the fierceneſs of his wrath: here was the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Lord gave him the <hi>mouth,</hi> and <hi>arms,</hi> and <hi>tears</hi> of his brother <hi>Eſau;</hi> what ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi> to all this? Gen. 33.10. <hi>I have ſeen thy face as though I had ſeen the face of God:</hi> He ſaw the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of God in changing the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his elder Brother: and that is it which ſweetneth all that a man doth enjoy; the <hi>loving kindneſs of God in all,</hi> is the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all: and this likewiſe doth <hi>Jacob</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, Gen. 33.5. <hi>Theſe are the Children
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170568:18"/>which God of his grace hath given me;</hi> and ſo he looked at them, as Gods wives, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſervants, and cattel; and this is the very life of the Covenant of Grace, when as the Lord is wrapped up in all his Bleſſings, when as he <hi>giveth himſelf,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> himſelf <hi>his Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>in Chriſt, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> unto his Church. This is the main thing given, <hi>God himſelf,</hi> the God of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, his <hi>Perſons, Nature, Ordinances, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> and now <hi>Abraham</hi> is made the Lord of the world, and ſo the Apoſtle doth interpret it, Rom. 4.13. <hi>The Promiſe that he ſhould be heir of the world, was not to</hi> Abraham, <hi>nor to his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of Faith;</hi> and this is that which <hi>Abraham</hi> did receive, in receiving the Lord to be <hi>his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>order</hi> of giving the Covenant, there is ſomething to be obſerved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. God giveth <hi>firſt,</hi> and not the Creature, it was not <hi>Abraham</hi> that gave unto God firſt; for which of all the creatures ſhall offer a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant unto the mighty God? Rom. 11.35. <hi>Who hath given unto him firſt? and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again;</hi> the Lord hath the pre-eminence in giving; for what ſhould <hi>Abraham</hi> give unto God, if God give not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto him firſt? he is the <hi>firſt</hi> giver.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He</hi> is alſo the <hi>firſt thing</hi> in order that is given: For doth he give the world firſt? or ordinances firſt? or any other ſpiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings firſt? No doubtleſs, the <hi>Lord</hi> is the firſt thing that he giveth by his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and with himſelf all things elſe alſo;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170568:19"/>Rom. 8.32. and there is the precedency of Jeſus Chriſt; he is given, and in him all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſings, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Eph. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And this for the order in giving the Covenant, not obedience firſt, nor faith firſt, nor any thing elſe firſt, but <hi>Himſelf</hi> is <hi>Donum primum, &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marium,</hi> and in him all his goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Manner</hi> of giving; in that he giveth himſelf, there is implied both the <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>eternety</hi> of the gift: <hi>Firmneſs</hi> therefore, and that unto eternity. In that he giveth <hi>himſelf,</hi> it muſt of neceſſity be done <hi>freely;</hi> for what can any creature give to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe God? if a man could give thouſands of worlds, they were not enough to redeem or purchaſe one ſoul; and if he had millions of worlds to give, what were they all to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſo great a gift as God himſelf is? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be of free gift; for the creature can do nothing to prevent God: God indeed may give with a purpoſe to receive back again; but he looketh to receive no more then what he firſt giveth us, and giveth us ſtrength of Will and Deed to give him back again. He required this of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>walk before him, and be upright,</hi> Gen. 17.1. but the very truth is, though <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall perform theſe things in an Evangelical manner; yet God himſelf doth undertake in this Covenant to be the Author and Finiſher both of his Faith and Obedience, Heb. 12.2. And this doth argue the marvelous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170568:19"/>freedome of the Covenant of Grace: for the Lord offereth it out of his Grace, without the foreſight of Faith, or Works; for he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to give both Will and Deed of his good pleaſure, Phil. 2.13.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> Did not the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, that he ſhould give himſelf back again, or elſe the Lord would not give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               <p>Truly then it had not been of Free-grace: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> But as you ſee ſometimes great Princes will take in a neighbour-Nation into league with them, and not tell them of it: ſo doth the Lord deal with his elect ones; he maketh a Covenant with Chriſt, and taketh us into that Covenant, otherwiſe he ſhould not at all intend it effectually, nor ever give himſelf unto us; for we are not able to give our ſelves unto him till he firſt take us. For if <hi>Abraham</hi> did give himſelf, it was becauſe God did take him firſt; and therefore it is that the Apoſtle telleth us that the Lord <hi>took hold</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might take hold upon the Lord, Phil. 3.12. <hi>I follow after, if that I may apprehend that, for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> is not he the Father that hath bought us? hath not he made us, &amp; eſtabliſhed us? Deut. 32.6. If we give up our ſelves unto the Lord, it is becauſe the Lord hath taken hold upon our hearts firſt.</p>
               <p>But doth not the Lord require of him to circumciſe his ſeed the eighth day? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>So he doth indeed, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> but the Lord giveth him that alſo: God the Father ſeeth it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for their everlaſting Salvation, therefore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170568:20"/>he doth give him <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and giveth him the <hi>grace</hi> to circumciſe his children: I know that the Lord doth call for many things under a covenant of Grace, but then the Lord doth</p>
               <p n="1">1. Work thoſe things in them: And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He will have them know, that thoſe things are nothing, without the working of his Grace. It is true, he may circumciſe <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but who ſhall circumciſe the <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>Iſaac?</hi> it is a ſmall matter to circumciſe the <hi>fleſh:</hi> ſo it is a ſmall matter for us to <hi>baptize</hi> with <hi>water;</hi> but who muſt waſh us from our ſins, ſave only the Lord our God? ſo that he doth ſecretly intimate, that what his poor ſervants do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, he would do it inwardly and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall at the Lords commandment march about the city <hi>Jericho</hi> ſeven daies together, and not ſpeak a word, and hereby the wals of the city ſhall fall down flat; of what uſe were theſe weapons to ſuch an end? what would the Lord ſhew his people hereby? hereby he teacheth them to know by what ability and power to bring mighty things to paſs: they ſhall do duties as the Lord commandeth them, but he himſelf will breath in them to make them effectual. For though we do never ſo much, yet we cannot reach unto the accompliſhment of any good thing; <hi>not by might, nor by ſtrength, but by my Spirit:</hi> the Lord therefore by his Spirit muſt work all our works for us: Here is the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of Gods Covenant, in that the Lord giveth himſelf firſt, Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170568:20"/>away from them to do them good: but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> You may ſpeak of <hi>Conditions</hi> in this kinde: but the Lord doth undertake both for his own part, and for our parts alſo: for as the Covenant is <hi>free,</hi> ſo the Lord will freely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and preſerve all his Elect, and all from the immutable Nature of God; it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that God ſhould lye: <hi>I am Jehovah, I change not,</hi> Mal. 3.6. <hi>therefore ye ſons of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob <hi>are not conſumed:</hi> Hence ſpringeth our Eternity, and perſeverance unto it (Rom. 11.29.) <hi>for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance:</hi> And <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) that he that hath begun this work will perfect it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6. <hi>The Lord took your Father</hi> Abram, <hi>and brought him from the other ſide of the floud:</hi> Joſh. 24.3. and he being called, obeyed, Heb. 11.8. Thus (mind ye) the Lord dealeth in the Covenant of Grace; he looketh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that look not towards him, as is held forth, Hoſ. 3.3. where the Lord biddeth the Prophet love a woman that was an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs, and ſay unto her, <hi>Thou ſhalt be for me, and I will be for thee;</hi> this is a branch of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when the Lord doth undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>ſeed</hi> unto himſelf; his <hi>giving himſelf</hi> unto them doth breed a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>returning of them</hi> unto him. Now it may be demanded,</p>
               <p>How the Lord did take <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed to be his people? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>By a double Act: As, <label type="milestone">

                  </label>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Of Preparation,</hi> not on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170568:21"/>nor on his ſeeds part, but on his <hi>own part,</hi> the Lord prepared them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord did <hi>inveſt</hi> him with the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings</hi> of this Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Preparation: the Lord prepareth them by a double work of his Spirit, which are manifeſt in all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By a ſpirit of <hi>bondage,</hi> whereby he cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth off the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from all worldly intanglements, and delights: thus God took <hi>Abraham,</hi> and brought him from beyond the floud, and ſo doth he take men off from their countreys and fathers houſes; he ſeparates them from all ſuch things, that he might draw them unto himſelf: thus he dealt with the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and called them to be a ſingular People unto himſelf, Deut. 7.6, 7, 8. Thus doth the Lord deal with all thoſe, whom he receiveth to be a people unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: by this ſpirit of Bondage, he draweth them from all their ſinful luſts, and paſſions, ſo as that they can finde no life in them, nor any hope of mercy at all in any thing: by this Bondage, the Lord ſetteth home unto the conſciences of men, the weight and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their ſins, and bindeth them under the ſenſe of his wrath unto fear of Damnation. The Romans firſt received the ſpirit of Bondage to fear, before ever they came to receive the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption, Rom. 8.25. But thus the Lord doth even ſhut a Soul out of doors, that he may open to him another and a better way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord alſo prepareth his people by a Spirit of <hi>burning,</hi> which upon a Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170568:21"/>he doth ſhed abroad into the hearts of men: this we read of, Mal. 4.1. <hi>Behold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, and it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi> It is ſpoken of the Miniſtery of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> which did burn like an oven againſt all the Scribes and Phariſees, and left them neither the root of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, nor the branch of their own good Works. He cutteth them off from the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Mat. 3.9. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves that you have</hi> Abraham <hi>to your Father; for I ſay unto you, that God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto</hi> Abraham: and ſo by cutting them off from the Root, he leaveth them no ground to truſt on. From their good Works alſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt cutteth them off, Mat. 6.2. <hi>When thou doſt thine alms, ſound not a Trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do,</hi> that they may have the glory of men: and verſ. 5. <hi>When thou prayeſt, thou ſhalt not be as the Hypocrites are,</hi> &amp;c. and verſ. 16. <hi>When ye Faſt, ye ſhall not be as the Hypocrites are, of a ſad countenance,</hi> &amp;c. This was a Spirit of Burning which the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by the Miniſtry of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> to burn up all the Hypocrites like ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the beauty of their works were bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by it: and this is Gods uſual manner of dealing. Now there are many under a ſpirit of bondage, that never came under a ſpirit of burning; and they being convinced of ſin, and of the danger thereof, yet hope to wreſtle it out, and work it out by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170568:22"/>till the ſpirit of Burning come and conſume all that falſe confidence. But when the ſpirit of Burning cometh, he then blaſteth all the fruits and branches of their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and burns up all that a man hath wrought, or can work. And this is that which the Prophet Eſay, chap. 4.4. ſpeaketh of, that <hi>the Lord will purge away the filth of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion, with a Spirit of Judgment, and of Burning;</hi> the one is a ſpirit of Sanctification, and the other is a conſuming Fire, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them not to build any comfort upon any works that they have done: this may Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites reach unto in their judgments, ſo as that they may be convinced that they have neither root within them, nor branch growing upon them; and yet in the mean while they may not come unto a Spirit of Adoption: but hereby alſo the Lord uſeth to prepare his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Some bleſs themſelves in worldly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and never came unto a ſpirit of bondage. Some do finde comfort in their performances, and never ſaw the vanity of their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: But there are thoſe whom the Lord doth carry further, unto a ſpirit of burning, even unto a ſenſible feeling of Gods wrath burning againſt whatſoever is as ſtubble, (and ſuch is a mans own gifts, and parts, and worth) ſo that now the poor ſoul findeth that he hath no Root, not any ſure mercy of the Covenant of Grace, that he can reſt upon: no green branch of righteouſneſs remaining, but all is blaſted and broken in pieces, according to what the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> ſaith, chap. 40.6, 7. <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof is as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170568:22"/>the flower of the field: the graſs withereth, and the flower fadeth; becauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it:</hi> and ſo the Lord cometh to leave a man neither Root nor Branch: For by a ſpirit of Bondage the Lord blaſteth all fleſh: but when it cometh unto the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fleſh, that is conſumed by a ſpirit of Burning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As God thus prepareth us for himſelf: ſo he doth <hi>give himſelf</hi> unto us, and <hi>taketh poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> of us by his bleſſed Spirit: the Father giveth himſelf and his Son by his bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (for the Spirit it is by which he doth viſit the hearts of his people) and this is the main Bleſſing of the Covenant of Grace. For the better clearing of it, it may be demanded,</p>
               <p>How doth the Lord <hi>give himſelf</hi> unto his People, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> the Spirit of God taketh up his ſeat in the ſoul, by making it a Temple unto himſelf, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son; and ſo are they <hi>made an habitation of God through the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 2.22. <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 4.6. (He ſpeaketh not of ſons by actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, but by Gods eternal Counſel.) The fame Spirit is alſo called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> whom Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed to ſend, Joh. 16.7, 8, 9. <hi>If I depart, I will ſend you the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter; and when he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment; of ſin, becauſe they beleeve not in me:</hi> this the Holy Ghoſt convinceth men of, to be the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170568:23"/>greateſt miſery of the ſoul, that they have not beleeved upon Jeſus Chriſt. And look as a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of gold, or ſome weighty metal falling into a veſſel of water, daſheth out all that is in the veſſel, to make room for it ſelf: ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt coming into the ſoul, daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out all watry confidences, and maketh room for himſelf. And in very deed, becauſe the heart of man is not only like unto water, but is hard as yee, and ſtrong; therefore the Spirit of God cometh like fire, and melteth the iron ſtone of the heart, and ſoftneth it into fleſh; ſo that now the ſoul is utterly at a loſs, not only in regard of his ſins, but in regard of his beſt works alſo; and is moſt of all convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of his unbelief. Now this holy Spirit of God being thus ſhed abroad into the heart, at the very firſt entrance of it into the ſoul, as it doth chiefly convince the ſoul of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; ſo,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame Spirit <hi>worketh Faith</hi> in the ſoul, to yeeld himſelf unto the Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and this is a true ſaving work; he now ſubmitteth unto the will of God: ſo that the Spirit of God becometh unto the ſoul not only as a Spirit of <hi>burning,</hi> to conſume all that is like ſtubble; but doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo melt the iron ſtone of the heart, and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it into <hi>fleſh,</hi> that the word may take deep impreſſion in it: Now there is room for Jeſus Chriſt, now Faith is wrought there; and now a ſoul can plead with God by Faith in Prayer: he ſeeth there is no former ſafe hold of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that he can plead, nor any righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own, but ſuch as hypocrites will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170568:23"/>quarrel for, and riſe up to maintain, as they did againſt <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> pleading their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and their righteouſneſs: with theſe things a poor ſoul is not ſatisfied: <hi>but unto you that fear my Name, ſhall the Son of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſe with healing in his wings,</hi> &amp;c. Mal. 4.2. Herein is implied ſuch a reverent fear, as diſtruſting our ſelves, giveth all the honour to the Lord Jeſus: this Fear of the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth Faith, and is of like nature to it: both of them diſtruſting our ſelves, and both of them giving all honour to Chriſt; the one out of confidence in him, the other out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to him.</p>
               <p>Thus it is in our <hi>Effectual calling;</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God taking poſſeſſion in our hearts, and working this Faith in us, thereby we ſubmit unto the Lord; and this is Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, that maketh us one with Chriſt: for our Effectual calling bringeth us to be one with him, 1 Cor. 1.9. <hi>God is faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This fellowſhip ſtandeth in two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>unity</hi> of the Spirit, 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In a <hi>lively Faith</hi> on our parts. So that by Beleeving this is the firſt thing we do, we yeeld unto the work of God; when this ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger man cometh, to wit, Chriſt by his Spirit, we yeeld up all our armour to him; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtandeth our coming on to be in Chriſt, and in God the Father, by this Spirit of God that taketh poſſeſſion of the heart, and hath not only burnt up root and branch of our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal righteouſneſs, but hath alſo melted us
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170568:24"/>unto a ſoft frame to yeeld up our ſelves unto the Lord; and now we are fit for any duty, the Lord having poſſeſſed us with his powerful preſence: herein lyeth our Effectual calling; and this is true ſpiritual union between the Lord and our ſouls. Now this Faith thus wrought in our Effectual calling, is not built upon any conditional promiſe of Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent in us, nor can it be built upon any: but upon ſome abſolute free Promiſe of God unto the ſoul, according to what we read, Iſai. 43.22. to 25. <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me O</hi> Jacob, <hi>but thou hast been weary of me O Iſrael; thou haſt not brought me the ſmall cattel of thy burnt-offerings, neither haſt thou honoured me with thy ſacrifices: I have not cauſed thee to ſerve with an offering, nor wearied thee with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe: Thou haſt bought me no ſweet cane with money, neither haſt thou filled me with the fat of thy ſacrifices; but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities: I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy ſins.</hi> In all this we ſee the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute freeneſs of the Grace of God. But if the Promiſe be conditional, it is a condition ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to Faith, not antecedent before it.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> Though ſome may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by ſuch an abſolute Promiſe, yet ſome other mans Faith may be built upon a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Promiſe, and the condition preexiſtent.</p>
               <p>I pray you conſider it: <label type="milestone">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170568:24"/>Was this work wrought before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or after? Every Chriſtian knoweth, that all works before converſion are but droſs, and dung: to apply promiſes to ſuch works, were indeed to build upon a ſandy foundation. What ſay you then to works after converſion? All works after converſion are fruits of Faith; and if they proceed from Faith, then faith went before, then a mans faith was not built upon a conditional promiſe; how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it ſhould? when as all works after converſion, are either fruits of Faith, or elſe they are no true ſanctification; then faith went before in order of Nature, and ſo was not built upon works, but works upon it.</p>
               <p>Our Faith cloſeth with Chriſt upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Free-Grace,

Upon a promiſe of Free-Grace therefore my Faith is built, as upon the promiſe of God in Chriſt reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world unto himſelf, 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. The word is (it may be) ſpoken outwardly unto all Chriſtians: but if God do ſet it home particularly unto any Soul, that man receiveth this Gift of God, and it is made his own: Firſt, he beleeveth the promiſe of Free-grace, and then afterward come other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that do bear witneſs unto the right application of that promiſe unto the ſoul: but I am firſt built upon a promiſe of Free-grace, or elſe there is no true cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt: well then, being thus united unto Chriſt, from this union with Chriſt do flow all other bleſſings and benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170568:25"/>of Grace: for hence ſpringeth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt in all <hi>spiritual bleſſings,</hi> that the Lord hath wrought for us in him; and they are two of them <hi>Relative</hi> bleſſings (as they are called by Divines) &amp; two of them <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> bleſſings. The two Former are laid up in Gods own Hand, and are not created in us: the other two poſitive Bleſſings are created in us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the uncreated Bleſſings, They are
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Adoption.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list> And they ſpring immediately <hi>(ſimul &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel)</hi> from the former union with Chriſt; for as ſoon as ever the Spirit of God is in our hearts, and hath wrought faith, that we do not ſpurn againſt Jeſus Chriſt, but receive him, now is the Divine Nature of Chriſt in us, and we are now become the ſons of God, as Chriſt himſelf is. Look as in a mans firſt natural conception, as ſoon as ever one doth live, there is an heir of <hi>Adam,</hi> even ſo ſoon as the ſoul liveth: ſo it is in the new ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Birth; as ſoon as the Holy Ghoſt cometh, and hath wrought this Faith, now is the Seed of God in us, the Life of Chriſt, and the Spirit of God; and now we are the <hi>Sons</hi> of God, as we read Joh. c. 12. <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power to be the ſons of God.</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon this union with Chriſt, we are Sons by <hi>Adoption;</hi> and as we are adopted, ſo likewiſe our <hi>ſins</hi> are now imputed unto Chriſt, and his <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> unto us, and ſo our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170568:25"/>are <hi>juſtified.</hi> For how, and when was <hi>Adams</hi> ſin imputed unto us? Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, in ſin did my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive me:</hi> So ſoon as over there was life, it was the life of <hi>Adam,</hi> and then the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin falleth immediately upon the ſoul. So when we do receive Chriſt by this living Faith, having the Life of Chriſt in us, we have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt (the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>) imputed to us. For what doth the childe in the womb? though it doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor evil, but is meerly paſſive, yet ſinful it is, and a childe of <hi>Adam:</hi> So alſo in this our Regeneration, the ſoul receiveth Chriſt by that Faith which the Lord hath wrought in it, whereby alſo it is made capable of the priviledg of <hi>Adoption;</hi> and ſo the Lord <hi>accounteth</hi> us his children, and <hi>imputeth</hi> the Righteouſneſs of his Son unto us, whereby we are <hi>Juſtified.</hi> Theſe things do dwell in Gods Boſome, and the meaning of them is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards revealed unto the ſoul; but communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated they are, both that of <hi>Adoption,</hi> and this of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> by this gift of faith wrought in us. But we are ſtill upon the firſt work of converſion, wherein a Chriſtian is only paſſive, and receptive; and truly it muſt needs be ſo in the firſt work of God upon us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the <hi>Poſitive Bleſſings</hi> that are wrought in us: They are
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Glorification.</hi>

               </p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:170568:26"/>
               <p n="1">1. When we are called, then are we <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> then are we Glorified, 1 Cor. 1.2. as in our natural conception, as ſoon as ever the childe liveth, <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is firſt imputed, and then there is a proneneſs in it to carry it cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto fin, and to make it backward unto any goodneſs: So when the Life of Chriſt is diſpenſed unto the ſoul, now the Lord comes to convey with it Juſtification, or pardon of ſin, and then there is a promiſe in a Juſtified perſon to walk in the ſpirit, Gal. 5.25. <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit. By Faith our hearts come to be purified,</hi> Acts 15.9. and the ſame Spirit quickneth us unto holy duties, <hi>ſo that we live, yet not we, but Chriſt liveth in us;</hi> neither are we only in his hand, but the Spirit ſanctifying, draweth us into an holy confederacy to ſerve God in Family, Church, and Common-wealth; and this San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification groweth, and encreaſeth more and more, 2 Cor. 7.1. 1 Theſ. 4.1. &amp; 5.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other poſitive gift is <hi>Glorification,</hi> which we read of, Rom. 8.30. <hi>Whom he called, them alſo he juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them alſo he glorified:</hi> this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> mentioneth, 1 Pet. 5.10. <hi>The God of all grace hath called us into his eternal glory it Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> And in truth, he hath begun the work from the time that he firſt began to ſanctifie us, 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>He hath ſaved us, and called us:</hi> from the very firſt time that God worketh upon the ſoul graciouſly, there is a glorious work in that ſoul; and others may ſee it, though himſelf ſometimes ſeeth nothing that he hath received. Thus we ſee the ſecond
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170568:26"/>branch of the Doctrine opened, How the Lord doth <hi>receive Abraham</hi> and <hi>his ſeed</hi> unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, preparing them by a ſpirit of <hi>Bondage,</hi> and of <hi>Burning,</hi> and then taking poſſeſſion of them ſavingly by the <hi>inhabitation</hi> of the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the ſame Spirit begetting Faith, we are alive in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo come to be <hi>Adopted,</hi> and <hi>Juſtified</hi> in him: the ſame Faith which receiveth Adoption and Juſtification, doth begin to ſtir a little, and to breath forth into gracious deſires, and ſome holy mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and beginneth now to put forth ſuch works as the holy Ghoſt carrieth the ſoul an end in; working all our works in us, and for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now for the third and laſt part of the Doctrine: The Lord took the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed to be the <hi>Mediator</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, unto whom all the Promiſes were made, Gal. 3.16.</p>

And here is the root of all the life and power of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, to wit, this Perſonal Union of the Son of man, with the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, which is a firm and everlaſting Union</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Gods giving him to be a <hi>Covenant,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170568:27"/>Iſa. 42.6. <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant of the People, for a Light of the Gentiles.</hi> What is meant hereby? the Lord meaneth, that he giveth him to be a <hi>Mediator</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To receive from God all the <hi>promiſes</hi> and <hi>gracious gifts,</hi> whatſoever is requiſite for him to be, <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet;</hi> and all theſe things he receiveth from the hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Col. 1.19. for <hi>it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell:</hi> thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a plentiful Redeemer. And as the Lord gave him to be a <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſo he giveth him alſo to <hi>work</hi> all things needful for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; partly by his <hi>paſſion,</hi> and <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> unto the Death of the Croſs, Phil. 2.8. and partly by fulfilling all the righteouſneſs of the Law, Mat. 3.15. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt did fully accompliſh whatſoever was requiſite for him to accompliſh in his own Perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth perform all things needful for the <hi>Application</hi> of this Redemption unto our ſouls, Iſa. 26.12. And to this end, he it is that ſheadeth abroad his Spirit into our hearts, Joh. 15.26. &amp; 16.7. and when this bleſſed Spirit cometh, he applieth unto the ſoul all this gracious Redemption of Jeſus Chriſt, by giving Jeſus Chriſt and all the Fruits of his redemption, and by working all thoſe bleſſed works, that the ſouls of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come to be partakers of; and ſo performeth all thoſe conditions that are required on our parts: if it be needful for us to have <hi>Faith,</hi> he will work it in us; if it be needful for us to live a <hi>life of Faith,</hi> he will help us ſo to live,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170568:27"/>for <hi>it is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God:</hi> Eph. 2.9. Thus hath the Lord made him a compleat Mediator of this holy Covenant; and whatſoever we receive, we receive from him: for unto him firſt, as the head of the Church, are all bleſſings given; and unto us, <hi>all promiſes in him are Yea, and in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. for though Chriſt be not a ſinner in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet in reſpect of his Members, he is many times loſt in them, though not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and poor in them, though not in himſelf: for us therefore he receiveth the Promiſes of God; and that is the great ſecurity of them, that they are laid up ſafe in him, and belong unto us if we have union with the Head; and in him we perform whatſoever God requireth; whether we pray, or preach, or hear, we do all in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, going forth in his ſtrength, and power: Col. 3.17. Thus is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt a firm ſurety of <hi>this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Covenant, ſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> This may teach us a broad <hi>difference</hi> between the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace. In the Covenant of Works,</p>
               <p>The Lord offereth Himſelf as a Father, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Diff. </seg>1</label> his Son as a Redeemer, his Spirit as a Sanctifier; but this is ſtill upon a condition of obedience: <hi>if they ſhall keep his Laws, and obey his voice, then they ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto him above all people,</hi> Exod. 19.5, 6. This alſo they undertake to do, Deut. 5.27. <hi>All that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, we will hear it, and do it; but, O ſaith God, that there was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170568:28"/>ſuch an heart in them,</hi> verſ. 29. When they rebelled, he did not pardon them graciouſly, but the Angel whom he ſendeth with them, he biddeth them <hi>beware of him, and obey his voice, and provoke him not, for he will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your tranſgreſſions, for my Name is in him:</hi> In the Covenant of Grace he will, but not in this: here is indeed a conditional Redeemer and Saviour; and ſo it is expreſſed, Iſa. 63.8, 9, 10. <hi>He was their Saviour; in all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them in his love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, and vexed his holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and fought againſt them: with many of them God was not well pleaſed</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with none of them) <hi>but overthrew them in the wilderneſs:</hi> Thus in the Covenant of Works all is given upon condition of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>The Lord giving himſelf, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Diff. </seg>2</label> his Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon condition, though it be but to Works, yet he is pleaſed to receive, them into ſome kinde of <hi>Relative <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> expreſſed, Jer. 32.32. <hi>Which my Covenant they brake, although I was an Husband to them.</hi> He was married unto them in Church-Covenant, this was ſome kinde of union: He was their God, and they were his peculiar people; and yet the Lord caſt them off, a generation of his wrath, from this Marriage-Covenant between them and him: from this union there ſpringeth a kinde of Faith, by which the ſoul cleaveth unto the Lord in ſome meaſure; elſe there could not be this Marriage-Union; and this Faith is that of which you read, Pſal. 106.12, 13. <hi>They
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170568:28"/>beleeved his words; they ſang his praiſe: they ſoon forgat his works: they waited not for his counſel:</hi> So alſo Exod. 14.31. it is ſaid, <hi>They beleeved the Lord, and his ſervant</hi> Moſes: this is that Faith which men may receive, and yet may Apoſtate from it, ſpoken of, Heb. 6.3, to 6. <hi>For a while ſome do beleeve, and in time of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation fall away,</hi> Luk. 8.13. But all that Faith was never grounded upon any free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Grace, but all was built upon <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> and upon no higher ground. In the 2 Chron. 13.8, to 12. marvellouſly ſtrong are the expreſſions of <hi>Abijah,</hi> when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> came againſt him; You think to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Kingdom of the Lord in the hand of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. Have not you caſt out the Prieſts of the Lord? ſaith he, &amp;c. <hi>But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forſaken him; and the Prieſts which miniſter unto the Lord are the Sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>and the Levites wait upon their buſineſs; and they burn unto the Lord every morning, and every evening Burat-ſacrifices, and ſweet Incenſe; the Shew-bread alſo they ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the pure Table, and the Candleſtick of gold, with the Lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord our God, but ye have forſaken him. And behold, God himſelf is with us for our Captain, and his Prieſts with ſounding Trumpets to cry Alarm against you. O ye children of Iſrael, fight ye not againſt the Lord God of your fathers, for you ſhall not prosper.</hi> Thus we ſee what Faith he did expreſs; and hereupon (verſ. 18.) the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought under, and the children of <hi>Judah</hi> prevailed; and yet this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170568:29"/>Kings heart was not perfect with the Lord his God: 2 King. 15.3. and yet (minde you) a ſtrong confidence he had, that the Lord was with him, and that he would be preſent with his own ordinances; there Faith built upon fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Ordinances, like unto that Faith in the Scripture before alledged, Luk. 8.13. Men are affected with the Word, and beleeve, and finde comfort; and all this ſpringeth from that Relative communion which they have with the Lord; they finde refreſhing in their way and work, and many times take it for the very Seal of the Spirit of God; all which may be, and often is found in Hypocrites: but here is the difference; In a Covenant of Works God giveth himſelf <hi>conditionally;</hi> in that of Grace, <hi>abſolutely:</hi> in both, he maketh a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in the one of <hi>Grace,</hi> the other of <hi>Works,</hi> in which the voice of the Lord is, If you be true to me, then I will not renounce you; and in this Covenant is Faith found, but it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built upon ſuch changes as they finde in themſelves, and will in the end vaniſh utterly away.</p>

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:170568:29"/>Pſal. 78.37, 38. <hi>Being full of compaſſion, he forgave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not; yet they were ſuch whoſe heart was not upright with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> this is plainly held forth in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Mat. 18.23, to the end: when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had not wherewith to pay his Lord, he fell down and worſhipped him, ſaying, Lord, have patience with me, &amp; I will pay thee all, his Lord was moved with compaſſion, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and <hi>forgave him the Debt: but when he had not like compaſſion on his fellow ſervant, then his Lord was wroth, and charged all his iniquities upon him, and caſt him into priſon until he ſhould pay all that was due unto him:</hi> So that this pardon is not everlaſting, but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite from outward puniſhment, and from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pangs of conſcience many times; and this they take for pardon of ſin, and acceptance in Jeſus Chriſt, when indeed they are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: So likewiſe their <hi>Sanctification</hi> is but for a moment, they come at laſt ſome of them <hi>to tread under foot the Bloud of the Covenant wherewith they were ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.29. For, Chriſt was but a conditional Redeemer unto them: they had only gifts of Tongues, and utterance, and wiſdome, and diſcerning of Spirits, and a common Faith: which things are not that Sanctification which is a fruit of Saving Faith; but only ſuch gifts as do ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them unto the work of the Miniſtery perhaps, or Magiſtracy, and fit them for houſhold-government, or the like: and ſo much poſitive work there is in them, as doth make them in ſome meaſure fit for the work,

                  </label> All the men in the world are divided into two Ranks; Godly, or Ungodly; Righteous, or Wicked; of wicked men, two ſorts; ſome are notoriouſly wicked, others are Hypocrites: of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> two ſorts (and you ſhall finde them in the Church of God) ſome are <hi>waſhed Swine,</hi> others are <hi>Goats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Swine are thoſe of whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>they return unto their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the myre:</hi> like unto theſe are ſuch men, as at the hearing of ſome Sermon have been ſtomack-ſick of their ſins, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their wicked courſes, but yet the ſwines heart remaineth in them; and as a ſwine, when he cometh where the puddle is, will readily lie down in it; ſo will theſe men wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the puddle of uncleanneſs, when their conſcience is not pricked for the preſent: but theſe are a groſſer kinde of Hypocrites.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another ſort that go far beyond theſe: and thoſe are <hi>Goats,</hi> ſo called, Mat. 25.32, 33. and theſe are clean beaſts, ſuch as chew the cud, meditate upon ordinances; and they divide the hoof; they live both in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and particular calling, and will not be idle: they are alſo fit for ſacrifice: what then is wanting? Truly they are not Sheep all this while, they are but Goats; yet a Goat doth loath that which a Swine will readily break into: but where then do they fall ſhort of the nature of Sheep? A difference
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170568:30"/>there is, which ſtandeth principally in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Goat</hi> is of a <hi>capricious Nature,</hi> and affecteth eminency; <hi>his Gate alſo is ſtately,</hi> Prov. 30.31. <hi>Agur</hi> reckoneth the Hee-Goat among the four things that are comly in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And they are full of <hi>Ambition;</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide ſwamps, and holes, but will be climbing upon the tops of mountains; there is not that plain, lowly, ſheep-like frame, that attendeth unto the voice of the ſhepherd to be led up and down into freſh paſtures: they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon their own ends, and will outſhoot God in his own bow; and therefore when they have done many things for Chriſt, he will ſay unto them, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity:</hi> more eminency they did affect, then they were guided unto: thus it was with <hi>Jehu,</hi> who in his zeal for God, thought to promote himſelf; and herein he will not be perſwaded of his ſin, and therefore walking along in crooked waies, the Lord led him forth with evil doers; he cometh at length to cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſins of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made Iſrael to ſin: notwithſtanding you may receive a Goat into Church-fellowſhip for all his capricious Nature, and he will be a clean creature, and of much good uſe: the <hi>five foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> (Mat. 25.2.) were all of them <hi>virgins,</hi> all of them abhorring Idolarry, and all go forth to meet the Bridegroom; and yet they are <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and never ſhall you make them wiſe, to be all for Chriſt, in him, and from him, only hearing and obeying his voice.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:170568:31"/>
               <p n="3">3. They are of a <hi>rankiſh nature</hi> all of them, ſpecially the old Goats will have an unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reliſh, far from the pleaſant ſweetneſs that is in a Sheep; and herein hypocrites are greatly different from the Sheep of Chriſt; and many times alſo they do puſh with the ſhoulder the poor ſheep of Chriſt, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, Ezek. 34.21. <hi>And they mar the paſtures with their feet,</hi> and will be at length <hi>mudling the fair waters of the Sanctuary alſo:</hi> And in their beſt ſanctification they fall far ſhort of a ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like frame of ſpirit, diligently to hear the voice of the ſhepherd; this will not be found in the ſanctification of the beſt hypocrite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven; they may go far, and yet at length fall away: this is no <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> but if you ſearch the Scriptures diligently, you will finde theſe things to be true.

               <p>There is a fourth <hi>Difference</hi> between the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Works</hi> and of <hi>Grace</hi> in re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:170568:31"/>Heb. 8.6. Thus we ſee in this firſt Uſe the difference between the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>I might (in the ſecond place) from hence alſo gather an Argument againſt the whole Body of <hi>Arminianiſm;</hi>

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminiansſm,</hi> come to be confuted from hence; for in truth they hold forth no more but a Covenant of Works: and if we will not grant Faith and good Works to be the cauſe of all the bleſſed gifts of God, they will take it marvellouſly unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but they were as good deliver unto us another Goſpel.</p>
               <p>This may alſo ſerve to teach the people of God to bear a gracious reſpect unto thoſe that are under a Covenan tof Works, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170568:32"/>calleth any unto fellowſhip with himſelf in a Covenant of Grace, but ordinarily he firſt bringeth them into a Covenant of Works. The ignorant look to be ſaved by their good prayers, and by their good ſerving of God. After, God may terrifie and humble their ſouls with the ſenſe of their palpable wickedneſs. Then they may reform and truſt in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances: and then God may burn up all ſuch falſe confidence; Therefore thoſe that are under a Covenant of Works, may belong unto the Lord, as well as thy ſelf; pray for them therefore; <hi>Paul</hi> was under a Covenant of Works, <hi>Steven</hi> prayeth for him; and as moſt conceive, that prayer was effectual unto his Converſion, and <hi>Paul</hi> was as dear unto the Lord as <hi>Steven</hi> himſelf was. Men under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, the Lord may bring them home unto himſelf, by daſhing all their works in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſhewing them the preſidence of their ſpirit: and the Lord will alſo come and pluck away the caul from their hearts; and then they will have none in heaven but Chriſt, nor in the earth in compariſon of him; and then the Holy Ghoſt convinceth them of this ſin above all their other ſins, that they have not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on Jeſus Chriſt. Do not therefore cenſure any ſuch, as to ſay there is no likelihood that they ſhould ever come to have fellowſhip with Chriſt; for if the Lord make them to fall down before him, and to yeeld up their ſpirits unto the Lord in holy reverence, and fear, theſe have now received ſome fecret ſmoking affections (beſides a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>burning</hi>) which the Lord will not quench.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170568:33"/>of Jeſus Chriſt: for if there be no Name under heaven given, whereby we muſt be ſaved, but only Jeſus Chriſt; nor his Name, but in a way of fellowſhip with him; then it ſeemeth to me apparently to follow, that whatſoever ſaving work there be in the ſoul, it is not there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt be there. It is true, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was ſent to ſubdue all fleſh, by a Spirit of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which burneth up carnal confidence in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all their fruits of righteouſneſs: here were indeed <hi>preparations</hi> for Chriſt, but theſe were not <hi>ſaving,</hi> they were ſtill children of wrath; <hi>ye ſerpents, ye ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of vipers,</hi> notwithſtanding all this.

And I ſuppoſe there is no difference there. But though there be no difference in mens judgments in this; yet it is an eaſie thing for Chriſtians to miſtake their evidence upon this very ground, and as much upon this ground as any: For when Chriſtians come to be really wrought upon, and finde themſelves diſcouraged from ſin, and ſo reform their lives, and give up themſelves to obey the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170568:35"/>Word, and finde comfort therein, (and great conſolation many times) in ſuch a caſe as this Chriſtians do much differ upon the point; and yet I do not know any of all the Teachers in this Countrey that withdraw their conſents from this Doctrine, that ſuch Sanctification as is wrought in hypocrites, though that it may reach to great improvements, yet it is no evidence of Juſtification at all. It hath been handled in another Congregation, (and I think not without weight of truth) that to diſtinguiſh in men between that Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which floweth from the Law, and that which is of the Goſpel, is a matter ſo narrow, that the Angels in heaven have much adoe to diſcern who differ: a work fitter for Angels to cut the ſcantling in it, then for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, though indeed there be great difference of the one from the other. Now though this do not tend to heal any difference in judgment; yet it is uſeful to heal a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of ſanctification, that may be found in all hypocrites.

               <p>And commonly under ſome one or other of theſe three, are put all the differences between the one Sanctification and the other: I ſpeak it, that it may be ſearched, and (God is my witneſs) not to unſettle the well-grounded comfort of any ſoul: but if any man hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170568:35"/>built upon an unſafe foundation, or hath built hay, or ſtubble; better it is to know it at firſt, whileſt there is hope in Iſrael, then when it is too late. In thoſe three things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, are all the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſanctification of Hypocrites, and of the Children of God; and they go ſo cloſe together, that you will ſay, it is not an eaſie matter to diſcern Juſtification by Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Root</hi> of it: The ſoul having fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt, by the Holy Ghoſt coming into the ſoul, and working Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. This is the Root of all Chriſtian <hi>Sanctification:</hi> Ezek. 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>he that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. and for <hi>Faith,</hi> it is Faith <hi>that purifieth the heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. and, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. So that Faith muſt concurre unto the rootedneſs of our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Chriſt. But the Apoſtle doth attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute both theſe Roots unto thoſe Chriſtians that ſhall afterwards fall away to ſin the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, Heb. 6. <hi>They have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> that <hi>heavenly gift</hi> was <hi>Faith,</hi> which the Apoſtle reckoneth chiefly among the <hi>Principles</hi> of our Chriſtian Religion, verſ. 1. A <hi>taſte</hi> they had of it; yet from both theſe they fall away: you know what was ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.10. <hi>The Spirit of God came upon him:</hi> And ſo did it likewiſe upon <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> acting them mightily in their adminiſtrations; and as they were thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170568:36"/>along by the Spirit: So likewiſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Bondage</hi> will marvellouſly prevail with the ſons of men, to draw them on to ſtrong works of Reformation, from whence they reap no ſmall conſolation; but think and ſay, (as <hi>Abiſah</hi> did) that the Lord is with them, whileſt they are with him: And as ſometimes <hi>David</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I beleeved, therefore I spake:</hi> So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> alſo, (Pſal. 106.12.) <hi>beleeved, and ſang the praiſes of God,</hi> upon the Red-ſea-ſhore, and yet were they but an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical generation. And if Hypocrites may work miracles in the Name of Chriſt, (as they did, and expoſtulate with Chriſt about it, Mat. 7.22. <hi>Have we not propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name caſt out devils, and in thy Name done many wonderſul works?)</hi> then may a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Faith work ordinary works in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity alſo: and therefore you ſhall read (Mat. 13.22.) that there is no fault found in the thorny ſoyl for their want of root, or for their want of depth of earth; for the want of both which, the ſtony ſoyl was taxed: but look as it is with the bran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </label> (will you ſay) there is a plain diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170568:36"/>for an Hypocrite is ever full of himſelf, but a true Chriſtian doth all in Faith: he ſeeketh God daily, and waiteth upon God daily; and theſe are not the waies of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
               <p>Conſider I pray you what the Word of the Lord holdeth forth as the Root of this Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and I will go no further then expreſs Scriptures: Iſa. 58.2. <hi>They ſeek me daily;</hi> and this is ſpoken of hypocritical Iſraelites: and for waiting, we often hear it ſpoken of the five fooliſh Virgins, <hi>they all went out to meet the Bridegroom,</hi> Mat. 25.1. though whileſt he tarried long, they all fell aſleep; and ſo did the wiſe Virgins alſo. And for more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>application of God</hi> unto themſelves, we finde that alſo, Hoſ. 8.2. <hi>Iſrael ſhall cry unto me, My God, we know thee;</hi> and yet (in the ſame Scripture) this <hi>Iſrael had tranſgreſſed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and cast off the thing that is good:</hi> And for a further act of Faith, which is a <hi>staying a mans ſelf upon God;</hi> what ſaith the Text? Iſa. 48.2. <hi>They ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael,</hi> (and yet theſe are obſtinate; their neck as an iron ſinew, and their brow as braſs) but it was not in truth and uprightneſs; True, it was not: But how ſhall we know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? Truly it is hard to perceive when men differ, and therefore it is not an eaſie matter to make ſuch uſe of Sanctification, as by it to bear witneſs unto Juſtification: and it will be a very hard caſe, yea much more difficult, when men cannot feel the preſence of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts, but want ſpiritual light: and when they do finde <hi>Faith</hi> in themſelves, they will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170568:37"/>finde it in Hypocrites alſo, even <hi>Faith to ſeek the Lord, and Faith to wait upon him,</hi> and <hi>Faith to apply him, ſaying, My God;</hi> and <hi>Faith to ſtay upon the God of Iſrael:</hi> and yet theſe men do vaniſh away in hypocriſie. This Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites may do: ſeeing therefore what eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of error may befal Chriſtians, whether this or that Grace may be of the right ſtamp, or no, it will behoove Chriſtians to be wary; for even Eagle-eyed Chriſtians will have much adoe ſo to diſcern of Sanctification in themſelves, before they ſee their Juſtification, as to cut off all Hypocrites from having the like in them. For the ſanctified frame of life in Gods children, and that which ſeemeth to be like it in Hypocrites; both of them ſpring from the Holy Ghoſt, and both from Faith: but now the Spirit of God hath this farther work in his own people, beyond what he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon others; though he melteth both, yet Hypocrites are melted as <hi>iron,</hi> which will return again to his hardneſs; but his own people are melted into <hi>fleſh,</hi> which will never return to his hardneſs more; neither can they reſt in any meaſure of ſoftneſs, unto which they have attained, but ſtill are carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Jeſus Chriſt. So that the one is a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Faith, and the other Perſevereth; though both work in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, yet this difference will be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; not only when Hypocrites come to be blaſted, but even in the midſt of their profeſſion. As for the Faith of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, it is not preſident of his own power, but his ſtrength lieth out of himſelf in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170568:37"/>Jeſus Chriſt, whereas hypocrites and legal Chriſtians are confident of their Faith, that they can make uſe of it unto ſuch and ſuch ends: they think they need no more but look up to Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; their work is at an end; and ſuch ſtrength they finde in themſelves, that they do not fear but that they ſhall carry an end all their work in a ſafe courſe to Gods glory, and their own: where as the ſtrongeſt Faith, even of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> (whoſe Faith was ſuch, as that none of all the Churches went before them) if it be not ſupplied, and ſtrengthned, they know, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> knoweth that it will warp; this may we ſee by comparing 1 Theſ. 1.3. with chap. 3.2, 10. and the Faithful people of God, Iſa. 26.12. acknowledge him to <hi>work all their works for them:</hi> and therefore as there is a real diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the preſence of the Spirit: ſo alſo in the work of Faith in hypocrites, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; for the one putteth confidence in himſelf, and the other in <hi>Jehovah.</hi> This is the firſt difference of Sanctification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is difference alſo in the <hi>Rule</hi> whereby they are guided: though both ſeek to the Word of God, and take delight in that, inſomuch as you ſhall not be able to difference them there, yet a great difference there is in the apprehenſion of the word: the one is ſo confident of the ſtrength and comfort that he hath in the word, as he will be ready to take it ill at Gods hand, if he finde not aſſiſtance from him, and acceptance before him. Now the other ſee their need they have of the Lord to maintain their ſtrength and comfort for</p>

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:170568:38"/>
               <p>them: this manner of affection we finde in <hi>David,</hi> when as the Lord had brought him and his people into a ſweet frame and temper of ſpirit, to offer willingly towards the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple; what ſaith <hi>David</hi> now? doth he think this to be enough? No, no, But he prayeth to the Lord, 1 Chron. 29.18. <hi>O Lord God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Iſrael, <hi>our Fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</hi> thus is he ſenſible, that theſe comforts and ſtrength would ſoon fail them, and they ſhould again wax barren and uncomfortable, if the Lord ſhould not ſtill keep them: and here is the nature of true ſtrength and conſolation in Chriſt; to look up unto the Lord to preſerve and maintain it; and ſo he is ſtill drawn nearer and nearer unto Jeſus Chriſt. But now though both attend unto the Word, as their Rule of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if you take it in the way in which the one and the other hold it forth, yet there is a great difference. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.6. Here is a <hi>Rule:</hi> what may not Hypocrites walk according to this Rule? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they profeſs no leſs, and they think it is enough, if they have but a rule in their eye; and therefore under a ſpirit of <hi>Bondage</hi> they are confident, and ſay, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord commandeth us, we will hear it, and do it,</hi> Deut. 5.27. and what ſaith <hi>Balaam? Though</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak <hi>would give me an houſe full of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord,</hi> Numb. 22.18. and yet he loved the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170568:38"/>wages of iniquity: and indeed thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo much in their own ſtrength, they come afterward to be weary of the Lord, and weary of his commandments; as Amos 8.5. <hi>When will the new Moon be gone, that we may ſell corn? and the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth wheat?</hi> &amp;c. and they ſay at laſt, <hi>It is in vain to ſerve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances?</hi> Mal. 3.14. Theſe are but like <hi>waſhed Swine</hi> that will crop graſs for a while in a fair paſture; but if you keep them long there, they will not delight in ſuch manner of feeding, but will rather chooſe to go into the myre, and into a jakes; (that I may ſo ſpeak with reverence to the Aſſembly) but as for <hi>Goats,</hi> they will delight in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord, Iſa. 58.2. <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to know my ways, and delight in approaching unto God:</hi> It is not a very hard thing unto them, nor grievous to keep ſolemn faſting-days together; they come willingly, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to come, therefore the difference will hardly be diſcovered; and unleſs you be a Chriſtian of a very clear diſcerning, you will not finde the difference.</p>
               <p>But an Hypocrite will not delight in all Gods commandments: if you take <hi>Herod,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  </label> he will <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> preaching, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form many things; but if it come to his not having his brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife, then put <hi>John</hi> into priſon; and in the matter of <hi>Herodias,</hi> off with <hi>Johns</hi> head.</p>
               <p>We ſee what hypocrites profeſs, Deut. 5.27. <label type="milestone">

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:170568:39"/>It is true, a difference in time will grow; but whileſt they hold forth <hi>univerſal obedience,</hi> how will the difference be diſcerned?

I have ſeen hypocrites (to outward view) well rooted, and more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table then I my ſelf; and for zeal, and love, the <hi>Galatians</hi> would have plucked out their eyes to have done <hi>Paul</hi> good; they thought themſelves bleſſed in his miniſtery, bleſſed ſouls they took themſelves to be: whereas the dear ſervants of God are ſlow to ſee ſo much goodneſs in themſelves, they ſee ſo much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> An hypocrite cannot aim at God as his <hi>laſt end,</hi> but will out-ſhoot God in his own bow; and at the higheſt, he ſeeketh no more but his own ſalvation, without reſpect unto the glory of God in it.</p>

                  </label> and in time will appear, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hypocrite thinketh to out-reach God in all the gifts that he hath received: but in the mean while, it is much that an hypocrite will do; and ſo much, that a poor Chriſtian will be put to much exerciſe, to finde a difference between himſelf and them: <hi>Jehu</hi> did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think that he had <hi>zeal</hi> for the Lord, as he ſaid, <hi>Come ſee my zeal for the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> but good <hi>Jonadab</hi> likewiſe did ſo perſwade himſelf, and therefore did readily joyn with him in his reformation; and when he proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a ſacrifice for <hi>Baal,</hi> he thought that <hi>Jehu</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:170568:39"/>would do no harm to himſelf in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Baal.</hi> Thus therefore ſometimes it cometh to paſſe; becauſe an hypocrite may for a long time finde all his own ends attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſeeking the glory of God, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did: but, but in concluſion, when a man, and his own honour muſt part; then either he muſt hold to his own glory, or elſe he muſt neglect it, and keep him cloſe to the honour of God: but in the mean time, what can I tell, but that I may ſhake hands with, and bid farewell unto Gods glory, when his and mine lie at ſtake together?</p>

                  </label> perſecution will not clear the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For though the ſtony ground indeed fell off upon point of perſecution, yet the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoyl did not ſo. Many Papiſts have died for their Religion; and how much more then may ſome hypocrite do it for the Truth? yea, even <hi>give his body to be burned;</hi> and yet want Jeſus Chriſt, and everlaſting ſalvation by him, 1 Cor. 13.3. Now when a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cometh, and ſeeth how much ſuch an one doth magnifie God both in doing, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and yet falleth away; It maketh him conclude, Surely I alſo ſhall at length turn away from the Lord. So that whether you look at the <hi>Root,</hi> or <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Scope,</hi> and bent of holineſs, an hypocrite will carry all things in ſo fair a way, that you ſhall hardly diſcover him to his very death; and when a Chriſtian cometh to meaſure his own Sanctification by this mans ſanctification, he will verily think
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170568:40"/>the one to be as light as the other; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be one that hath his wits well exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, marvelous much adoe he hath to clear himſelf in ſuch a point as this. There be that think there is no reality in hypocritical ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; but certainly it is a real work, the gifts be real, though common Graces; and not meer counterfeit pretences: there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome that do meerly pretend, and do but outwardly make fair weather in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but (beleeve it) it is not ſo in all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, there is a real work in ſome, Heb. 6.4, 5. <hi>They are enlightned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and are made partakers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. theſe things are real, and not imaginary: God caſting in their own ends, and their own glory in their way; the ſervants of God have given them the right hand of fellowſhip; and ſo long they have held out, that it was never known when they did apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: yea, and ſo glorious may this common Sanctification be, that it may dazle the eyes of the beſt of Gods children, and eſpecially of poor Chriſtians, and almoſt diſcourage them, when they ſee ſuch to fall away. This very point hath been one principal root of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm;</hi> as another is, that men receive Chriſt by their own <hi>Free-will:</hi> they are able to prove, that there is not only a pretence in hypocrites, but a real work; and ſo indeed the Scripture doth call it Sanctification, Heb. 19.29. now hereupon they do beleeve, that the very beſt of all the ſervants of God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from, and forſake their Juſtifying Faith: but there in they ſhew the bleat of a <hi>Goat;</hi> in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170568:40"/>ſo ſaying they condemn the generation of the Righteous. It is true, that the beſt of their righteouſneſs may dye; for they have known no more but the way of works. Thus much for the firſt Propoſition.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170568:41"/>both taken from the neceſſity of Faith, both to the acceptance of a mans perſon, and of his work: there is a neceſſity of the activeneſs of Faith in a mans ſanctification: <hi>The Lord had respect to</hi> Abel, <hi>and to his offering,</hi> Gen. 4.4. a mans perſon muſt be firſt accepted, otherwiſe all his work will not go beyond the work of a legal Chriſtian, and <hi>without Faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God:</hi> no acceptance therefore without faith. It is alſo neceſſary to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all ſpiritual and holy duties: for all ſanctification is from that faith which Chriſt doth convey into the ſoul: Now if the juſt man live by his Faith, whether it be the life of ſanctification, or conſolation; then no Chriſtian can diſcern his ſanctification to be lively, but he muſt diſcern his faith living in it; he muſt ſee his faith, deriving ſtrength, and grace, and life from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or elſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve his ſanctification to be the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Goſpel: for as there can be no true Sanctification, unleſs there be Faith whereby the perſon is accepted, and whereby life is received to act in all ſanctification; ſo there can be no knowledge of Sanctification, but there muſt be knowledge of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a mans perſon is accepted, and whereby ſtrength is conveyed to Sanctification: for if a poor ſoul be doubtful of his acceptance with the Lord, he is where he was, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Sanctification, and wanteth comfort; for this doubt remaineth, whether he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, or no; which (until the Lord do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a mans Faith unto him by the revelation of the holy Ghoſt) he is ſtill at a loſs in: for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170568:41"/>though true Sanctification be an evidence of Juſtification, yet it ſelf muſt be firſt evident. Thus we ſee by this third Propoſition, that a further light is required to the ſight of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>

A real diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is, both in the <hi>root,</hi> and in the <hi>rule,</hi> and in the <hi>ſcope</hi> which they aim at; and ſo it will appear to be at the laſt day: Mat. 2.23. <hi>Depart from me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity, I never knew you:</hi> though they came and told him that they wrought by Faith in him: indeed they ſtood in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him, but not as members to the head, only as branches to the vine, which may be cut off, and yet the vine not maimed; but if the members ſhould be cut off, any one from the other, then is the body maimed, and Chriſt will not ſuffer his body to be maimed: but take you never ſo many branches from the vine, and it is not maimed, but will bring forth the more fruit: if therefore there be no more fellowſhip between Chriſt and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, then between the branches and the vine, you may take them away, and yet not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170568:42"/>hurt the vine. But wherein ſhould this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtand? It is very hard to conceive; in ſo much that thoſe who have been moſt exact, and diligent to enquire into it, have profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that it is Angels work; very hard it is ſo to diſtinguiſh them from Gods own children, as not to diſcomfort poor Chriſtians, nor to imbolden hypocrites; we muſt be tender there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the leaſt of Gods children may not want their bread: Better leave 99. ſheep, then that one poor ſtray ſheep ſhould not be ſought after; and better an hundred hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites periſh, then that one poor Chriſtian ſhould want his portion; and yet it is not meet that hypocrites ſhould wallow themſelves in the fellowſhip of the Saints, and alwaies bleſs themſelves in their carnal condition. If you ſhal ask a difference in the <hi>Root:</hi> both of them are <hi>partakers of the Holy Ghost;</hi> Hypocrites may have a <hi>taſte,</hi> and a poor Chriſtian will fear that his beſt fellowſhip with Chriſt is but a <hi>taſte,</hi> and that manifold experience maketh good. Wherein then lieth the difference? doth the Spirit of God leave the heart of an hypocrite <hi>ſtony,</hi> and <hi>unmelted?</hi> It is ſo indeed with the <hi>stony,</hi> but not with the <hi>thorny ſoyl;</hi> for the hearts of ſome hypocrites are melted as iron ſtones; they may come to melt about their own eſtates through fear and ſorrow: and ſo all thoſe melt that want not depth of earth, as the thorny ſoyl did not: but minde you, they will grow hard again, as iron, or lead will do, after it hath been melted. Now look at the Spirit of God when he cometh to work ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, and he doth not only melt the heart,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170568:42"/>but <hi>taketh away the heart of ſtone, and giveth an heart of fleſh;</hi> for it is not enough to <hi>break</hi> a ſtone, it will be a ſtone though it be broken; but when the Lord changeth it into fleſh, then it will be hard no more; but though a man may have many temptations, yet the Lord will keep his heart ſoft for ever. This is the firſt difference between hypocrites and Gods own ſervants in the <hi>root;</hi> though both may work in the Name of Chriſt; yet as the one is <hi>temporary,</hi> and the other <hi>perſevereth:</hi> ſo this difference you ſhall finde between common and ſincere Chriſtians; and that not only when legal Chriſtians are blaſted of God, but even then when they do moſt flouriſh in their profeſſion. The true Faith of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is never preſident of his own ſtrength, but goeth out of himſelf, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on Jeſus Chriſt: whereas the legal Chriſtian is confident in his Faith, that he can make uſe of it to theſe and theſe ends which are before him. He thinketh there is no more needful, but to look up unto Chriſt; and ſo his work is done: whereas take you the ſtrongeſt Faith of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> who were grown to ſuch height, that none of the Churches were before them; yet the Apoſtle doth not think their Faith ſtrong enough, but prayeth for the ſupplying of ſomething that is lacking in their Faith: otherwiſe, when it is at the beſt it will warp; whereas one that hath but a temporary Faith, he is confident in the ſtrength of that Faith, inſomuch that he doth not fear but to carry an end his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in a ſafe courſe to Gods glory, and his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170568:43"/>own: thus we ſee there is a real difference between the preſence and work of the Spirit in an hypocrite, and in a childe of God: in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, we ſee there is a difference in the Faith which is given unto both of them; the one hath <hi>confidence</hi> in <hi>himſelf,</hi> the other in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> Iſa. 26.12, 13. This is the firſt Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the <hi>Root</hi> of their profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is difference alſo in the <hi>Rule</hi> by which they walk: though both ſeek to the Word, and delight in that, you ſhall not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference them there; yet this difference you ſhall finde in their apprehenſions; the one is confident of his comfort that he hath in the Word, the other ſeeth need that the Lord ſhould maintain his comfort for him, 1 Chro. 29.18. <hi>David</hi> prayeth thus: <hi>O Lord God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Iſrael, <hi>our Fathers, keep this for ever in the thoughts of the hearts of thy people, and prepare their hearts unto thee.</hi> As being ſenſible that this their comfortable frame of ſpirit would ſoon fail them, and they would quickly grow liſtleſs unto ſuch ſpiritual work, as then they had been about: &amp; this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true conſolation in Jeſus Chriſt, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to have recourſe unto the Author of it, to preſerve it. Now though both attend unto the Word, yet here they differ: The one hath enough if he can ſee the <hi>Rule,</hi> like to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 5.27. <hi>All that the Lord our God ſhall speak unto thee, we will hear it, and do it:</hi> they have enough if they have the <hi>Rule:</hi> but a Chriſtian attending rightly unto his rule, findeth it far off from him to walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it; unleſs the Lord be pleaſed ſo to ſet
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170568:43"/>it home unto him, as that by his power he may be carried an end in obedience unto it: for though he know, and ſee his <hi>Rule,</hi> yet he wanteth ſome body to rule his heart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Rule; otherwiſe, though the <hi>Rule</hi> be ſtraight, his walking will be crooked; as a childe will write crookedly, though his line be ſtraight: ſo a Chriſtian man is ſenſible how his feet and hands will ſhake, when he cometh to walk or do any thing by a rule; therefore he doth wholly look unto Chriſt, as being ſenſible of his own inability, unleſs he finde help and ſtrength from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is difference between hypocrites and Gods people in the <hi>ſcope</hi> and <hi>end</hi> which they aim at: though both aim at the glory of God, yet both cannot attain to this, to make the glory of God their laſt end; but the one of theſe do ſecretly winde about to their own glory in the end: as <hi>Jehu</hi> doth, 2 King. 10.16. <hi>Come, ſee my zeal that I have for the Lord:</hi> but he bringeth about his own glory by it, and here is the main deceit of the work: he ſeeketh the glory of God in himſelf, and in his own hand; whereas the principal care of Gods own people is, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught to be, the glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt: but the other, his chief care is to have it ſeen that God is glorified by his hand; Come, ſee the zeal that I have.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> Is it not a great glory unto God to be glorified by my hand?</p>
               <p>Yes brother; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> but there is a great deceit in it: for many a man will work much, ſo far as his own glory is wrapped up in his actions, and like it well ſo long as God may be glorified in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170568:44"/>him: but all this while he wanteth thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle affections after the glory of God for Gods ſake. But how then ſhould a man ſeek to promote the glory of God? If it be the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, which a man ſeeketh after, he will then rejoyce as much that God may be glorified by his brother, as by himſelf; and that is the ſpirit of a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed: ſo that the name of Chriſt may be magnified, it's no matter by whom; <hi>I therein rejoyce, yea, and will rejoyce,</hi> ſaith the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Phil. 1.18. If any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aimeth at Gods glory then only, when it may be an honour to his profeſſion, no thank to you brother for that; much cloſe work may be found, ſo long as both are carried an end together: but if when I hear that my brother glorifieth God, I could have wiſhed that ſuch a thing had been done or ſpoken by me; and it is the worſe becauſe it is not done by my hand: if that, which is the rich goodneſs of God to my brother, be not my rejoycing, it is becauſe of the Core of hypocriſie in my heart. Thus have we ſeen particularly the difference between Legal and Evangelical holineſs.</p>
               <p>We proceed ſtill in this fourth Uſe, to a fifth Queſtion</p>
               <p>If Jeſus Chriſt be the firſt Gift that is given to the children of God, before he giveth right unto Promiſes, or to me to challenge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yea, before he giveth me any other gifts of his ſaving grace; then any ſoul may ask this Queſtion:</p>
               <p>Of what uſe are promiſes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> if they be not to bring me to Chriſt? yea ſpecially, to what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170568:44"/>end are conditional promiſes made (that is to ſay, Promiſes to ſuch and ſuch Qualifications) if I may not take a Promiſe in the one hand, and a Qualification in the other hand, and bring them both to God, and lay hold upon Chriſt with both hands, in the ſtrength of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to this Qualification? Thus ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Queſtion, if God give <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> firſt, before any other bleſſing; as we read before, To <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his <hi>Seed</hi> were the <hi>Promiſes</hi> made, (he meaneth unto <hi>Chriſt</hi>) and <hi>all the Promiſes are in him Yea, and in him, Amen:</hi> no having of Promiſes therefore before Chriſt: to what purpoſe are they given then, if not to bring me unto Chriſt? It is a point needful to be known, becauſe we read promiſes in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture daily: and certainly great uſe is to be made of them; and if we ſhall make no other uſe of them, but to bring us unto Chriſt; and God hath not ſanctified them unto that end; then we ſhall take them all in vain, and the Name of God that is called upon them.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>threefold uſe of Promiſes</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to wit, 1. <hi>Before</hi> union with Chriſt: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> 2. <hi>In</hi> union with Chriſt: 3. <hi>After</hi> union with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before</hi> union with Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Benefit </seg>1</label> there is a threefold uſe of Promiſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are of uſe for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to teach all the people of God what great and glorious things are laid up in Jeſus Chriſt, even <hi>the unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 3.8. and this all the Promiſes of God do hold forth: if the Lord promiſe to be your Father, your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, your Shepherd, your Head, your Root;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170568:45"/>if he promiſe to be any other bleſſing in the world to you; what ever promiſe you read, or hear, the Lord ſheweth you by it, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of Jeſus Chriſt; and that is no vain uſe of Promiſes, for a man to know by them the great good things that are treaſured up in Jeſus Chriſt by the Father: therefore they are called <hi>great and precious promiſes,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. Why ſo? becauſe they declare the great and precious priviledges and bleſſings in Jeſus Chriſt: therefore it is that the Lord will have all his people to look at him in his Word, and Promiſes, and to know what great good he hath in ſtore for all them that truſt in him, and ſeek after him in Jeſus Chriſt. Thus all the promiſes of Grace declare his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as Cant. 5.10. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand:</hi> ſo do all the Promiſes declare him to be a plentiful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and a mighty Redeemer of all his people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they are of uſe for Doctrine, ſo for <hi>inſtruction:</hi> it is good for the honour of God, to know them; but <hi>inſtruction</hi> is a further thing, and diſtinct from <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. by inſtruction men are taught not only what to <hi>know,</hi> but what to <hi>do;</hi> to know, and ſee whither they ſhould reſort for the enjoyment of all thoſe precious bleſſings that God hath laid up in Jeſus Chriſt; and this is a precious uſe of the promiſes, that by them the ſoul ſhould be thus inſtructed whither to go for life and ſalvation: ſuch inſtruction we finde, Iſa. 45.22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all ye ends of the earth:</hi> here is a direction to me
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170568:45"/>before I look, whither to look; I do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee great things, and ſo vaniſh away, but I am directed to look, and be ſaved thus are we taught of God likewiſe by his bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent, and be baptiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of ſins: for the Promiſe is unto you, and to your Children, and to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call:</hi> thus are we taught by the Promiſes, whither to look for life and ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Promiſes ſerve alſo for <hi>exhortation;</hi> as the Scripture laſt alleadged holdeth forth: for ſo many bleſſings as you ſee propounded in the Promiſes, ſo many <hi>invitations</hi> are there to perſwade, and provoke mens Souls to come unto Jeſus Chriſt; as old <hi>Jacob</hi> ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked his ſons, ſaying, <hi>Why ſtand ye gazing one upon another? behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.1, 2. ſo ſaith the Lord to the ſons of men in his Promiſes; Why ſtand you gazing in the want of this and that bleſſing? is there not pardon of ſin, and all manner of bleſſings in Jeſus Chriſt? thus is the Soul exhorted not onely to look for mercy, but not to reſt till he may enjoy it. Though it be not the Promiſes that can by their own power (without the Spirit) carry men an end: yet this is the <hi>end</hi> to which God giveth them, to ſtirre up the Sons of men, not to reſt in beholding the good things in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but to exhort them to provoke themſelves and one another to look after the Lord: thus did the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhort the Jews, and teſtified to them of the free grace of God in his Promiſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.40. and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170568:46"/>indeed, the promiſes in themſelves are ſtrong grounds of Exhortation, to ſtirre up the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all Gods people to look to Jeſus Chriſt, and to come unto him, in whom ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rich grace is laid up. Thus do the promiſes of God furniſh both Miniſters and People, with Doctrine, with Inſtruction, and with Exhortation in their kinde.</p>
               <p>Now there is a threefold effect that they have in ſome of all ſorts, good and bad, that live in the boſome of the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have a power of <hi>Illumination:</hi> they will enlighten the mindes even of Hypocrites, and men that are endued with no more but common gifts, as well as the people of God: of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>who were once enlightned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and had taſted of the good word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When not onely enlighting, but a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing is expreſſed, An Hypocrite may have a <hi>Taſte</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt in the Promiſes, and be ſo affected with him, that he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all other things in compariſon of him, ſo as that he cometh to reſolve for his part never to forgo him; and hath ſo much confidence in God, that he ſaith with <hi>Haman,</hi> Whom will the King delight to honour more then my ſelf? and this illumination, he taketh to be a ſtrong and effectual converſion unto the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Promiſes have a work of <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> upon the Soul: if any man refuſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, they leave him unexcuſable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25, 26. &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye have refuſed: I have ſtretched out my hand,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170568:46"/>and no man regarded: but you have ſet at nought all my Counſels, and would none of my reproof: I will laugh at your calamity,</hi> &amp;c. thus is their bloud juſtly upon their own head, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and deſpiſe his Promiſes, and they ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their condemnation another day: and to this end the Apoſtle maketh uſe of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39, 40, 41. <hi>Be it known unto you men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you forgiveneſſe of ſins: and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes: <hi>beware therefore, leſt that come upon you which is ſpoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: Behold, you deſpiſers, wonder, and periſh, &amp;c.</hi> A ſtrange Application of ſuch a gracious Promiſe; a ſign, there is a power in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes even unto this end. Thus we ſee there is a marvelous gracious uſe of Promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Union with Chriſt, as to help Miniſters and people with matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> and <hi>Exhortation,</hi> ſo alſo to awaken men unto <hi>Illumination,</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> and to <hi>ſeal them up</hi> unto everlaſting deſtruction if they turn their backs upon them.</p>
               <p>As the Promiſes are of uſe before our Union with Chriſt: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ben. </seg>2</label> ſo <hi>In</hi> our Union with him they are of great uſe; for when the Lord giveth himſelf to the Soul, he doth it in a promiſe: He cometh unto the Soul riding (as it were) upon the Chariot of a Promiſe, and begetteth faith in the Soul by the Promiſe, or ſome ſuch word of grace as is equipollent to a promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11. whereby we receive Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170568:47"/>though before him we can have no Promiſe, yet in a Promiſe we do receive him. This is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt ſtroke of cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt; he giveth himſelf, and we take him as he offereth himſelf, even in a Promiſe: ſuch a like Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of himſelf we read of, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Ye are the Children of the Prophets, and of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God made with our fathers, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>And in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed: unto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to beſſe you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities:</hi> Here is Chriſt offered in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of free grace, without any previous, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious qualification mentioned. Howbeit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them that heard the word, believed, and the number of the men was about 5000: about 3000 of them believed before; ſo that here are 2000 that believe upon this gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: the Lord Chriſt is offered to them, and they receive him by faith. Thus we ſee that Promiſes are not vain things, but there are great uſe of them; <hi>before</hi> our Union, all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are of excellent uſe, as alſo <hi>In</hi> our Union.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>After</hi> our Union with Chriſt, they are of abundant uſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: They were of uſe before we were in Chriſt, for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and for <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> and for <hi>Exhortation:</hi> but now they are of more efficacy in the ſame kinde, and</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſerve for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to teach us, that there is not onely free grace in Chriſt, but there are gifts of grace in Jeſus Chriſt, and all the Treaſures of the good things of God are in him, and all the bleſſings of the promiſes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170568:47"/>made unto qualifications are laid up in him alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſerve for <hi>inſtruction,</hi> to direct us whither to look for qualifications, and the bleſſings Promiſed unto them; namely, to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to receive the bleſſing through him, and the qualification by the ſame hand: for they are firſt fulfilled in him; there is no good <hi>Condition,</hi> but it is found in Jeſus Chriſt, no <hi>bleſſing</hi> belonging thereunto, but it is found in Chriſt alſo; in him therefore they are to be ſought for: ſo that though a poor Soul ſee himſelf wretched, and blinde, and naked, yet he hath an husband in whom all riches is laid up: this he is taught to know by the Promiſe, and directed alſo to go to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that enjoying him, he may enjoy all good things in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="5">5. They are of uſe to <hi>work</hi> all theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in us, to which the bleſſings are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed:

                  <hi>By the exceeding precious promiſes we are made partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. and this is no ſmall work, or uſe of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that from them ſhould ſpring all our gracious qualifications; for the Lord having promiſed ſuch bleſſings in them, theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes being received and enjoyed, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated on by us, we <hi>beholding them, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord Jeſus in them, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. this great power there is in the promiſes to help an end the work of God in the ſoul of a Chriſtian: ſo that, though they were never given to bring us to Chriſt, yet to this end they were given, to work all thoſe qualifications in us to which the bleſſings are promiſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They are of uſe to <hi>provoke</hi> and <hi>ſtirre up</hi> Chriſtians to all ſuch duties to which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are promiſed; they ſtirre them up effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually: The Lord maketh a Promiſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. that <hi>ſuch as touch no unclean thing, he will receive them, and be a father to them, and they ſhall be his ſons.</hi> And mark what uſe the Apoſtle maketh of this conditional promiſe, chap. 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes (dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved) let us cleanſe our ſelves from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the fear of God.</hi> Implying, that the having of theſe promiſes ſtirreth up Gods people unto duties, and the Lord is wont to breath in them, and ſo to ſet forward the work of cleanſing in the hearts and wayes of his ſervants.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They are of uſe further, to <hi>ſtrengthen faith;</hi> for the Lord that hath made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170568:49"/>will accompliſh them for his ſervants, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 32.9, 10. <hi>Jacob</hi> there putteth the Lord in minde of his promiſe, and ſaith, <hi>O God of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham, &amp; God of my father Iſaac, and the Lord, which ſaid unto me, Return unto thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</hi> and he was now returned according to the appointment of God; but what now doth he plead the condition? minde in the next words: <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:</hi> Yet now, though hepleadeth not any worth at all, yet ſeeing the Lord hath promiſed ſuch a mercy to him, he prayeth for it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother:</hi> thus his faith is ſtrengthened, though he doth not plead his worthineſſe to receive mercy.

So when the Lord promiſeth to heal the back-ſlidings of his people, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.4. their hearts are ſtrengthened to come unto the Lord, and to ſay, O Lord, thy words are true, let it pleaſe thee to heal the back-ſlidings of thy ſervants.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170568:49"/>Thus by the promiſes of God, the faith and faithfull prayers of Gods ſervants are both of them ſtrengthned together.</p>
               <p>Now let me further ſay thus much, Let us rightly diſcerne what uſe to make of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Scriptures; take heed you do not cloſe with promiſes before you have <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſpecially take heed you make not uſe of promiſes to a qualification to give you your part in Jeſus Chriſt, neither be taken aſide to make account that the Lord did give you him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gratiouſly in a conditional promiſe; for theſe are aberrations from the Covenant of Grace: Conſider therefore well what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be, and what uſe the Lord would have us to make of them: It is not for a woman to take her husbands inheritance before ſhe take his perſon; and you know that all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and all the promiſes are (as it were) the Inheritance of the Lord Jeſus, given unto him, and to no other, but in his name; and therefore there is not any Soul under Heaven that can challenge his right in Chriſt at the firſt by any promiſe, till Chriſt firſt be given: if you know that you are in Chriſt, you may then know that the promiſes are yours, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſhall not be able to know your right in Chriſt by your right in the promiſes; and therefore do not turn them upſide down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſcope and intendment of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace: we may take occaſion by them to admire the goodneſſe and grace of God, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſſe, which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee!</hi> thus ought we to conſider of them,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170568:50"/>and whither to look that we might enjoy them, and the bleſſings in them: If you ſhall ſay, We have been converted, and we have had gratious changes wrought within us; be not deceived: ſuch work may reach no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then conviction, and you may come at the laſt to turn your backs upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Conſider therefore, did ever the Lord give <hi>himſelf</hi> to be one with you? whenſoever the Lord doth ſtrike up the bond of Union, it is in an <hi>abſolute,</hi> and <hi>free-promiſe</hi> of his grace. Truſt not therefore unto every leaning of your Souls upon conditional promiſes; for ſo you may build upon a <hi>Covenant</hi> made upon a <hi>work,</hi> and in the end you, and your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will fail together: but when you read how the Lord hath made ſuch promiſes to ſuch and ſuch qualifications, then conſider that thoſe things are indeed requiſite to be found in you; but who is there in heaven, or earth that is able to work them in you? there is none but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and unleſſe you have him to be <hi>in you,</hi> you cannot have any of theſe things wrought in you. But, will a poor Soul ſay, I am not able to reach the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> therefore all the promiſes of the Goſpel do fall heavy upon a man, and he ſeeth that they are too burdenſome, and weighty for him; he doth not ſay, Here is the qualification, and here is the bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to it, and therefore I will take it to my ſelf, but one that is taught of God, doth forthwith go, and pray unto God, that he will ſet him in the way of thoſe bleſſings, and that ſo he will make him partaker of them;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170568:50"/>he prayeth that God will give him his Son, and that he will adorne him with his grace, as a bride of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus while the ſoul looketh towards <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and grace in him, the Lord doth ſecretly transform him into the image of Chriſt, by working ſuch qualifications in him, and then beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to that ſanctification which is wrought in his heart, thereby inlarging his ſoul with ſtrong conſolation in Jeſus Chriſt: and in the ſame way it is that the Lord doth ſtrengthen the faith of his people to believe that all thoſe things which God hath promiſed are accompliſhed in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Law ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in me ſo farre as Chriſt is <hi>in</hi> me; and therefore I come unto God in prayer to make good thoſe promiſes unto me in a right way, which would have been prepoſterouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied before Chriſt was given. And this may ſerve for anſwer unto this fifth queſtion.</p>
               <p>We come now unto a ſixth queſtion. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>6</label> If the Lord do give himſelf firſt in the Covenant of his Grace, this may then be a doubt, and a queſtion in a Chriſtian ſoul; If God gives <hi>himſelf</hi> before any bleſſing, before any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in order of nature (though he giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alwayes in a promiſe) or in a word that is equivalent to a promiſe, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9, 16. <hi>ch.</hi> 6.1. if we cannot claim any bleſſing from God at the firſt in any conditional promiſe, therefore not by any condition in our ſelves, but as we received all things from God, ſo we claim all things from God in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo do firſt ſeek for him, and for all things in him: If thus, <hi>to what uſe then ſerveth the Law

               </p>
               <p>Though the Lord giveth himſelf freely to the ſoul, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and his Son, and all the bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace, without reſpect unto any work of the <hi>Law,</hi> yet the <hi>Law</hi> is of ſpecial and notable uſe unto all the ſons of men, both unto them which are not yet brought home unto God by converting grace, and alſo to thoſe that are regenerate in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did obſerve that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion would ariſe upon the Doctrine of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. <hi>for if the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>cometh upon the people of God by Jeſus Chriſt; to what end then ſerveth the Law, which came</hi> 430 <hi>after? it cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annul to make the promiſe of God of none effect:</hi> to what end then ſerveth it? ſome ſay it is of no uſe, others ſay that it is of ſuch uſe, that they had rather renounce the Covenant of Grace then it: but the anſwer is, It is of eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial uſe both unto ſpiritual, and carnal men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, unto <hi>carnal</hi> men, and they are of two ſorts; ſome belong unto the <hi>election</hi> of grace,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170568:51"/>though they he not yet called; others are not written in the Lambs books of life, but will in the end finally periſh: and yet the <hi>Law</hi> is of uſe unto both ſorts of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For thoſe that are the <hi>elect</hi> of God, it is of uſe unto them, to aggravate their ſin, and to multiply it unto them as it were, that is to ſay, to aggravate the apprehenſion of the hainouſneſſe of ſin upon their conſciences, and to ſet home the burden of their ſins unto their ſouls, thereby to drive them to feel their great need of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom otherwiſe they ſhould for ever have deſpiſed. Thus the Apoſtle anſwereth in the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, <hi>The Law was added becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions:</hi> that they might clearly appear, and be aggravated thereby; that a man might plainly diſcern how be hath made himſelf liable unto the wrath of God, by ſo manifold breaches of ſo many Commandments in one kinde or other: the <hi>Law</hi> giveth clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin, and ſo much the more doth it ſet on the weight of it upon the conſcience, working fear in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. and hence it is that the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. that <hi>the Law was our School-master to Chriſt;</hi> as a School-maſter driveth his Scholar through fear unto this or that duty: ſo the Law of God driveth the ſoul through fear unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> not that it doth reveal <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Saviour and Redeemer of free grace, but the ſoul being once brought down under the ſence of ſin by the terrours of the <hi>Law,</hi> will readily and diligently hearken unto the news of Chriſt a Saviour: for being once made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170568:52"/>of his own inability to redeem himſelf, and unworthineſſe to be redeemed from the wrath of God, now is the Soul fitted to hear the voyce of the Goſpel, now is the news of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> beautifull, and glad tidings: and of this uſe is the <hi>Law</hi> unto the <hi>Elect</hi> of God, before they come under the Covenant of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But of what uſe is the Law unto other men? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, In regard of <hi>diſobedience</hi> it is of uſe unto them, and 2. the <hi>obedience</hi> to it is of uſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of <hi>diſobedience:</hi> for if men had not known ſin, it had been ſome pretence, though they had committed ſin; but when men have the knowledge of the <hi>Law,</hi> and yet commit ſin willingly, now they have no Cloak for their ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. verſ. 21. compared with 32. where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the great ſin of the Gentiles, and much more of the Jews, who <hi>though they knew God, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and that they which commit ſuch wickedneſſe are worthy of death, yet not onely do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> When a man ſhall not onely do ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but bleſſe himſelf in it, this aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateth a mans condemnation: if men will not come unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that they might have life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. what ſaith our Saviour in ſuch a caſe? verſ. 54. <hi>Do not think that I will accuſe you to the Father, there is one that accuſeth you, even</hi> Moſes <hi>in whom you truſt; Moſes</hi> will judge all thoſe that pleaſe themſelves in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and will not turn to the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> thus there is uſe of the Law unto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170568:52"/>perſons, their diſobedience will leave them without excuſe when they ſin againſt their conſciences, &amp; againſt the means which the Lord hath adminiſtred unto them: for though the Lord never gave them ſuch grace as did accompany ſalvation, yet ſuch <hi>Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he did give them, that they needed not to have broken his <hi>Law</hi> ſo many wayes, with ſuch wicked hands as they have done: therefore when they have been enlarged to perform many duties, and might avoid much ſin, and yet will ſin againſt their conſciences, and tread under foot thoſe means of grace that were committed unto them; It is then moſt righteous with God that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of what uſe is the <hi>obedience</hi> of the Law unto ſuch whom Gods Soul taketh no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in? Truely, it is of ſad and dreadful uſe unto unto them; for it ſerveth to <hi>harden</hi> them in their ſins, (though that be but an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental uſe thereof) their ſins are thereby made out of meaſure ſinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. They harden their hearts, 1. by their <hi>obedience</hi> to the Law, 2. by the <hi>Comfort</hi> which they take in that obedience; both theſe do marvellouſly harden their hearts. For the firſt of theſe, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 23.1. had kept ſo good a conſcience, that he knew not any ſin againſt the <hi>Law</hi> that he lived in; but though he was unrebukeable, he did count it all loſſe afterward, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. thoſe things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought had been his gain, now he <hi>counteth them but dung that he may win Chriſt:</hi> when a man attaineth to outward conformity
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170568:53"/>unto the <hi>Law,</hi> he is then ready to think it is indeed good for poor ſinfull men to look for ſalvation by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but for himſelf, he hopeth in his devotion, and that he is able to ſave himſelf: theſe are ſuch as juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And as their obedience to the <hi>Law</hi> is thus a ſnare unto them: ſo ſecondly, the <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> which they take in their obedience is a greater ſnare then the other: The ſtony and thorny ſoyl did hear the word with joy, and ſo thoſe Hypocrites, <hi>Iſai</hi> 59.2. <hi>did delight to approach
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170568:53"/>unto God:</hi> but what followed upon the delight which they took in God, and in holy Duties? it made them ready to expoſtulate with God, why he did not anſwer them according to their works: the delight which they found, did ſo fill their hearts with aſſurance of the grace of God, that they looked at their Duties as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tokens of the love of God unto their ſouls; and then when men come to find more comfort in their obedience, then in the grace of God in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it maketh them ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with God, touching the worth of their own Righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.10. <hi>Thou haſt found the life of thine hand, therefore thou waſt not grieved;</hi> as long as a man findeth life and comfort in his own duties and performances, what need can he ſee to be grieved for the want of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> or at the beſt, if he do grieve, and find his heart comforted in griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and delighting in the courſe of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he then thinketh he hath no need of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther ſolicitous about his ſpiritual eſtate. Thus we ſee plainly that the <hi>Law</hi> of God is of marvellous uſe in the days of the Goſpel, of great uſe unto thoſe that belong unto God, to break their hearts for ſin, and to drive them to <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> and for others, the <hi>diſobedience</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> leaves them without excuſe, that ſo diſobey it; again, the obedience of it, and comfort in that obedience, doth harden the hearts of others from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>But what ſay you then unto men that are under a Covenant of Grace, and brought unto fellowſhip with Chriſt therein? of what uſe is the Law of of God unto ſuch? is it utterly

And to that end he doth there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſpiritual and true meaning of the <hi>Law,</hi> that whereas the <hi>Phariſees</hi> held forth the outward letter of the <hi>Law</hi> to be obſerved one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as thinking that unleſs a man did commit the Act of Murder, he was not guilty of the breach of the ſixth Commandment; and if he committed not the Act of Adultery, he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed not the ſeventh Commandment, and ſo of the reſt: Our Saviour Chriſt expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the <hi>Law</hi> more ſpiritually, ſhewing that anger againſt a mans brother is the breach of the ſixth Commandment; and whoſoever ſhall look on a woman to luſt after her, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery with her in his heart, and broken the ſeventh commandment; thus Chriſt hath as it were revived <hi>Moſes:</hi> but as the <hi>Law</hi> is given by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is not a covenant of Works, but a commandment of well-doing; and he having given it, we take our ſelves bound to be ſubject to it. The Apoſtle alſo, preſſeth the Moral <hi>Law</hi> upon ſeveral relations of men, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is an honour to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that his ſervants ſhould be holy, as he is holy; it is for the glory of God, and he requireth it: The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> preſſeth it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8. to the end of the chapter. <hi>If you fulfil the Royal Law according to the Scripture, (Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf) ye do well.</hi> And again; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> Thus we ſee the Apoſtles of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> put it upon Chriſtians to keep the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170568:55"/>
                  <hi>Law</hi> of God, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the <hi>Law:</hi> for God will never juſtifie ſin to be no ſin, though he will juſtifie the perſon of a ſinner.</p>
               <p>Now as the Lord Jeſus giveth the <hi>Law,</hi> and as it were reneweth it, ſo he doth alſo give his <hi>Spirit</hi> unto his ſervants, enabling them to keep it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and do them.</hi> And again, <hi>I will put my law in their hearts, and write it in their inward parts.</hi> Now this <hi>Law</hi> would he not write in the hearts of his people, nor give unto them his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> enabling them to keep his <hi>Law,</hi> were it not his will <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that the <hi>Law</hi> ſhould be the rule of holineſs and righteouſneſs unto his people: hence it is, that the children of God, though they be not under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> yet take themſelves to be bound to the obedience of it; for if Jeſus Chriſt have given the <hi>Law,</hi> as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and if he have ratified it by giving them his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to teach and ſtrengthen them to keep it, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, yet ſincerely, then they take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to obey the <hi>Law,</hi> though they be under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> for do <hi>we make void the law through ſaith? God forbid yea, we eſtabliſh the law.</hi> For what need have Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of free Juſtification by Chriſt, if they were not bound to obedience by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Law? Therefore the free Juſtification of men under a free Covenant of Grace, doth eſtabliſh the obedience of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170568:55"/>
                  <hi>Law,</hi> otherwiſe what need they run to Chriſt to ſave them from the <hi>curſe</hi> of the <hi>Law?</hi> Why do we ſtill run to Chriſt for the continuance of our juſtification? But that we find our ſelves ungodly creatures againſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy <hi>Law</hi> of God: therefore if God have given men the <hi>Law,</hi> and his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> to ſtrengthen them in the obedience of it, and his <hi>grace</hi> to ſave them from the <hi>curſe</hi> of it; then Chriſtians are to know that they are bound to keep the <hi>Law;</hi> they lie under the <hi>authority</hi> of it, and dare not pluck their necks from under that yoke.</p>
               <p>Now, there are two <hi>Effects</hi> ſpringing from the ſubjection of Gods people to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As they take themſelves bound to the obedience of it; ſo they believe, and many times feel the <hi>fatherly diſpleaſure</hi> of God, when they tranſgreſs the <hi>Law:</hi> now the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Law</hi> could not bring them under Gods diſpleaſure, unleſs they were bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Commandment of the <hi>Law:</hi> this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure <hi>David</hi> was ſenſible of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.1, 2, 3. &amp;c. <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh becauſe of thine anger, neither is there any reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſin</hi> And many complaints of like nature doth he there make, which do all of them ſpring from the conſcience of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of the <hi>Law,</hi> which God hath framed in the hearts of his ſervants, whereby they reflect upon their ſin as the ground of all the diſtempers which lie upon their bodies or minds. This is the firſt effect of the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods people to his <hi>Law:</hi> they lie under
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170568:56"/>the faith and ſence of the danger of the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are under the faith and ſence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Gods <hi>gracious acceptance</hi> of their waies, when they are ſuitable to the bleſſed directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his word; not that they can raiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from the aſſurance of their juſtified eſtate, but by the ſame Spirit of God, whereby they are helped to obey the Commandment, they do ſee the Lords gracious <hi>approbation</hi> of them in their poor and weak endeavours: for <hi>the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous;</hi> that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, and approveth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.6. when the Lord by his Spirit boweth the hearts of his ſervants to obedience, then he knoweth and accepeth their obedience; <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt me, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me:</hi> thus the Lord beareth witneſs to his ſervants that he doth accept their works; ſo that they ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly know, and believe that the Lord doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their pooreſt and weakeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, unto which they are carried forth by his Spirit in the obedience of his word: This the Prophet <hi>David</hi> confirmeth, <hi>Pſal</hi> 18.20, to 26. <hi>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteouſneſs, according to the cleanneſs of my hands hath he recompenſed me; for I kept the waies of the Lord, &amp; have not wickedly departed from my God: for all his judgements were before me, and I did not put away his ſtatutes from me; I was alſo upright before him, and kept my ſelf from mine iniquity: therefore hath the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed me according to my righteouſneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cleanneſs of my hands in his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170568:56"/>with the merciful, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf upright,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of his righteous dealing with <hi>Saul;</hi> and whereas his enemies laid it to his charge, that he was an enemy unto <hi>Saul,</hi> the Lord beareth him witneſs that he had walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Saul,</hi> with a good conſcience: now the Lord having led him an end to deal juſtly, and righteouſly, and purely with <hi>Saul,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kept him from all the malice and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Saul,</hi> and maintained his cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Saul,</hi> and delivered him out of the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom the Lord had now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; herein the Prophet ſeeth the Lord accepting him, when in the name of his Son, by the power of his Spirit, he is helped to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto the Commandments of God. This is comfortable unto a Chriſtian ſpirit, when the Lord beareth witneſs to his ſoul, that he hath an eye to all the Commandments of God. And all this argueth that the ſervants of God, being in a ſtate of grace in Jeſus Chriſt, have looked at themſelves as bound by the Commandments of the <hi>Law,</hi> and as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the law to Chriſt,</hi> who hath given the <hi>Law,</hi> and power unto his ſervants ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep it, both by writing in their hearts a law of <hi>obedience,</hi> and by putting his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> within them: for if the people of God were not ſenſible of their bounden duty to the obſervation of the <hi>Law</hi> of God, they would neither have faith, nor ſence of Gods fatherly diſpleaſure when they negligently break theſe laws; neither would they be ſenſible of Gods
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170568:57"/>acceptance of their conformity thereunto; but we know what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> &amp;c. and truly the Lord doth often bear witneſs unto the integrity of his ſervants againſt the oppoſitions of men; ſo he did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> and to ſundry of the Saints of God: though the ſervants of God are not wonted thereupon to build their ſafe eſtate, yet this kind of Gods acceptance of their waies and obedience they do diſcern; yet in their beſt obedience, which they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, they ſee the need they have to go unto God for juſtifying grace, becauſe if they have failed in any one circumſtance, their beſt righteouſneſs is polluted; therefore they have need of Jeſus Chriſt to cover the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their moſt ſtrict performances. This <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was ſenſible of, when he had been very faithful in reforming the abuſes of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and of many other Ordinances of God: and though the Lord had helped him to undertake the reformation with much dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and ſucceſs; yet for all this he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unto Chriſt for acceptance and pardon, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Remember me, O my God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, and ſpare me according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy mercy:</hi> and what would he have done if he had been conſcious of ſome groſs ſin? He would then much more have run to the Lord Jeſus. Thus the <hi>Law</hi> is eſtabliſhed by faith; for there is no juſtified perſon, but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170568:57"/>he is very apprehenſive of his ſins, and ſo of his continual need of Chriſt, <hi>whoſe blood clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. and <hi>who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and just to forgive our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs,</hi> verſ. 9. who is <hi>an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate if any man ſin,</hi> and <hi>a propitiation for our ſins,</hi> Chap. 2.1, 2. and what do all theſe things argue? but that a Chriſtian being under the Covenant of the Grace of God, doth ſubmit himſelf unto this yoak of God. Thus far then a Chriſtian is under the <hi>Law</hi> to Chriſt; ſo far as the <hi>Law</hi> is under Chriſt, he is under the commandment of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and under the power of <hi>Christ,</hi> and under the diſpleaſure of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if he negligently ſin againſt the <hi>Law;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Chriſt</hi> he runneth for pardon, and cleanſing, and unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> he cometh for acceptance of his obedience: ſo that he hath no uſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> but unto Chriſt, and in and under Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But how is a Chriſtian <hi>not under the Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So far forth as the <hi>Law</hi> is not under Chriſt; I mean, ſo far as it is without Chriſt freely juſtifying of us by his grace, ſo far a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is freed from under the <hi>Law.</hi> In one word, a Chriſtian man under a Covenant of Grace, is not under a Covenant of Works. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>You are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> he meaneth, not under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> nor under the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> as of their husband, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1, 2, 3, 4. The husbandly <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9. that is, not the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> for elſe we are under the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but the Jewiſh
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170568:58"/>Teachers taught more, to wit, the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> unto ſalvation: not but that <hi>the Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully;</hi> he meaneth the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> but how ſhall a man uſe it lawfully? for it is not given unto a righteous man; but he reckoneth up the breakers of every commandment, and unto them it is given; <hi>to the lawleſs, and diſobedient; to the ungodly, and ſinners; to the unholy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane; to murtherers of fathers, and murtherers of mothers; to man-ſlayers, and whoremongers; and to them that defile themſelves with man-kind; to men-ſtealers, to lyars, to perjured perſons, and if there be any other things that are contrary to ſound Doctrine;</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is given unto ſuch (and unto none but ſuch) to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> them of their ſins againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> to <hi>humble</hi> them to the death, and to <hi>drive</hi> them out of themſelves, and conſidence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But how doth it appear that the <hi>Covenant of</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> is not given to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God? from hence it is manifeſt;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe a Chriſtian man neither looketh for <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> from his <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> nor feareth <hi>Condemnation</hi> though he fail in his Obedience; and this is a fruit of his exemption from under the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> for if a man ſhould look for Life by his Obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> and fear condemnation by the breach of it, this would bring a man under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> for the ſanctification of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> is life to them that obey; and to them that diſobey, death, and the curſe. But a Chriſtian looketh not for Life by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170568:58"/>and that is plain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Enter not into Judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified:</hi> ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>By the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified, for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin:</hi> therefore no hope of ſalvation from our Obedience to the <hi>Law.</hi> But methinkes (you will ſay) a Chriſtian may fear his <hi>condemnation</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to the <hi>Law.</hi> Truly this is a great ſnare, and this Doctrine will be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to many a poor ſoul, but without cauſe: Indeed, if God give a man to be under the Covenant of Grace, and not to ſee it, then he may fear; but if a man know himſelf to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Grace, then he doth not fear condemnation from his diſobedience: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to this purpoſe is the conſidence of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 49.5. where the Prophet calleth upon all People in the world to take notice of it, <hi>Both men of high degree, and men of low degree: Wherefore ſhould I fear in the dayes ſo of evil, when the iniquities of my heels ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs me about?</hi> wherefore? truly if there be any fear in the world, one would think this might procure it; what ſhould a man fear, if not this? <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth it, and would have all to know it, that there is no cauſe therein why a Chriſtian man ſhould fear, <hi>Wherefore ſhould I fear?</hi> &amp;c. though it ſhould follow you to the ſtocks, or to priſon, yet there is no cauſe why it ſhould make you fear: <hi>Men that truſt themſelves in their wealth, and boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the multitude of their riches, none of them can by any means redeem his Brother, nor give to God a ranſom for him, that he ſhould live for ever,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170568:59"/>and not ſee corruption:</hi> had <hi>David</hi> had nothing but the wealth of his Kingdom, he might have feared well enough; but here is his confidence, verſ. 15. <hi>God will redeem my ſoul from the power of the grave, for he ſhall receive me.</hi> But will not this make a Chriſtian wanton againſt God, and cauſe him to abuſe his libety to hardneſs of heart? no, no, brethren, this is the kindly melting of a godly heart, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Redeemers love drawing him from the power of the grave, and that he ſhould by his ſins pierce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; this melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his heart more then all his other ſins, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the abounding Grace of God, which where ſin hath abounded, grace aboundeth much more: thus when a man doth not look for life by his own Righteouſneſs, but knoweth the Redemption of ſouls to be more precious then ſo; this ſheweth a man not to be under a Covenant of Works, and then his very iniquity ſhall not make him afraid; there is ſuch a ſtate in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and let all men know it. But will it not make men think the worſe of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> profeſſion? No, <hi>David</hi> will have all to know it, that they may ſee the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between all worldly confidences, and the confidence of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> all their glory will leave them, to be like the Beaſts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and cannot redeem their ſouls, that the Lord onely might be exalted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a Chriſtian looketh not for <hi>ſalvation</hi> by his obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> nor feareth <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> by his diſobedience: ſo neither doth he ſeek for any <hi>bleſſing</hi> from his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor fear any <hi>curſe</hi> from his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170568:59"/>he ſeeketh not for <hi>bleſſings</hi> from his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and therefore if there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of bleſſing made to any obedience, though God ſhould help him to as much obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as might be, he doth not look for any bleſſing from that obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>To him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt; but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for righteouſneſs, even as David deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works.</hi> He looketh not for his bleſſedneſs from his works; though he ſhould perform all the conditions to which the promiſes are made, yet he expecteth all his <hi>bleſſing</hi> from free juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not ſin,</hi> this is the bleſſedneſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. It is true, the Lord doth bleſs the workings of his ſervants, and accept them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34, 35, 36. <hi>The king ſhall ſay unto them on his right hand: Come ye bleſſed of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world: for I was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and you gave me drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me; ſick, and ye viſited me: I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi> Thus Chriſt bleſſeth them: but they are not ſenſible of their good deeds, ſo as to expect bleſſings for their obedience ſake, and therefore they make anſwer, and ſay, <hi>Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungry, and ſed thee; or thirſty, and gave thee drink?</hi> &amp;c. neither do
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170568:60"/>they fear the curſe of God, or that their ſins ſhould ſeparate them from God: thoſe that are under the <hi>Law,</hi> are curſed indeed, if they do not continue in all things that are written in the <hi>Law</hi> to do them; but this curſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the elect by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This alſo is a third effect of the freedom from the Covenant of Works; that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth not look for <hi>conjugal comfort</hi> from his obedience, nor fear <hi>conjugal divorce</hi> from his diſobedience. In a Covenant of works, it is with a man, as it was with <hi>Leah, Jacob's</hi> wife, who expected love and fellowſhip from her husband, becauſe of her fruitfulneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.32. when ſhe brought forth her firſt-born, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Now therefore will my husband love me;</hi> and when ſhe brought forth her third ſon, ver. 34. <hi>Now this time will my husband be joyned unto me:</hi> but thus doth not a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Covenant of Grace; for when he hath done all he can, he is ready to ſay, <hi>I am an unprofitable ſervant, Luk.</hi> 17.10. and doth not challenge God for any of his dealing with him: he ſeeth he deſerveth not his daily bread, and ſo looks for no reward from his good works: though the Lord will graciouſly acknowledge his ſervants in what they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, yet they are not wont to plead any ſuch thing; which is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the practiſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.9, 10. &amp;c. <hi>O Lord God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Iſaac, the Lord which ſaidſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee; I am leſs then the leaſt of all the mercies and truth, which thou haſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170568:60"/>ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi> So he doth not preſs his performance of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to procure bleſſing, but acknowledgeth his unworthyneſs, and looketh for Grace from the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God. <hi>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother; for thou ſaideſt, I will ſurely do thee good.</hi> Nor doth a child of God fear divorce by his diſobedience, though it have been very great. Sometimes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have not onely rejected the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, but the Lord himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. but when <hi>Samuel</hi> had preſſed hard upon them for their ſin, Chap. 12. and they were truly humbled, then <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto them (<hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21, 22.) <hi>Fear not (ye have done all this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet turn not aſide from following the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your heart: and turn you not aſide, for then you ſhould go after vain things that cannot profit nor deliver (for they are vain) for the Lord will not forſake his people, for his great Name ſake: becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his people, therefore fear you not, he will not caſt you off:</hi> So that (mind you) a poor Chriſtian doth not fear divorce from his diſobedience; for if we ſhould look for bleſſing from the one, or curſing from the other, we were not under Chriſt, but under the Law: but he that is freed from the Covenant of Works, is freed alſo from expecting ſalvation, or fearing damnation from what he doth; he knoweth the Lord will hide his face from him if he doe evil, but he knoweth the Lord will not caſt him off for ever; yet he dares not commit ſin, but being under Grace, he is the more affected if he ſhall at any time diſpleaſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170568:61"/>God, and procure chaſtiſement to himſelf: and by this means the Lord doth mortifie his diſtempers. On the other ſide, if he do well, he will not ſay, Now my husband will cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and dwell with me; no, no, we are freed from the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. which we were not, if we look for conjugal love from God, for our obedience to the <hi>Law:</hi> it is true, if a man be married to the <hi>Law,</hi> his obedience unto it will ſupply comfort unto him; but if we be dead unto the <hi>Law,</hi> we have no life in it nor by it, but only in Jeſus Chriſt, from whom we expect our comfort: indeed we are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that we ſhould ſin againſt the grace of God, otherwiſe we look not at our obedience or diſobedience, to make us accepted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And finally, the ſoul doth not claim his right unto any <hi>conditional promiſe,</hi> by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the condition; nor doth he deny himſelf the bleſſing that the promiſe may reach forth unto him, though he be wanting in obedience to this or that Commandment: pregnant for this purpoſe is the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> (which we mentioned before) <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9, 10. who though he had a plain and a full promiſe of God, to do him good if he would return to his Country, and to his kindred, yet when he did return according to the word of God, he claimed not his intereſt in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for that he had done as God commanded him, but <hi>I am leſs then the least of thy mercies;</hi> and yet he cometh unto the Lord for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his promiſes, but not upon this ground; only for the ſake of mercy and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170568:61"/>truth, <hi>Deliver me I pray thee: for thou ſaideſt, I will ſurely do thee good, ver.</hi> 11, 12. ſo that (mind you) though the ſoul can make uſe of a conditional promiſe, and come to God for the bleſſing of it, yet not expecting it in the leaſt manner, by vertue of his obedience: and truly this is the freedom of a Chriſtian ſoul; whereas another man, if he have kept the Commandment, and performed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he then looketh for acceptance from God: as if the Lord make this promiſe, that <hi>he that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin, ſhall find mercy;</hi> this man confeſſeth his ſin unto God, and forſaketh it, and therefore he looketh for mercy: but this is not the manner of Gods people; and yet if they look for any mercy, it is in the way of God, but not becauſe of their own goodneſs; their hope is in the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and free grace of God: they may make mention to the praiſe of God, how he hath guided them, and carried them an end in his own waies; yet they challenge nothing from any thing that they have done, but put the Lord in mind of his free promiſe, that as of his free grace he hath freely promiſed: ſo from the ſame grace he may make good what he hath promiſed.</p>

Truly we have need that the Lord ſhould give us his holy Spirit to dwell in us, notwithſtanding all the gifts of his grace, though they indeed are neceſſary conditions to be found in the ſouls of all Gods ſervants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Follow peace and holyneſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> As if he made it of abſolute neceſſity to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not onely in another world, but for a comfortable condition in this world; <hi>follow</hi> Peace and Holineſs, as if ſo be that they were ready to fly away from a man: and indeed, the word doth imply no leſs; for <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo for <hi>Holineſs;</hi> the Apoſtle would have us make an holy kind of purſuit after it, as if it were ſtill withdrawing from us; which cometh through the corruptions of our heart; for we are ſoon weary of holy Duties, as Prayer, or Conference, or the like: if Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs be in any thing, it ſoon groweth weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170568:65"/>to fleſh and blood; but though our weak and feeble nature will be withdrawing us from Holineſs, yet the Lord would have us to <hi>follow</hi> it, and purſue it; and ſo ſhall a man be withdrawn from the world, and from the temptations and bad examples thereof. Do not ſay, What, ſhall we be wiſer then our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? and, Is not Moderation beſt in all things? but conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Follow</hi> ſtill after it, even unto perfection; and his words do intimate the reaſon of it, <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> for what is <hi>Holineſs</hi> in its own nature? it is that which giveth God his due, as <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> giveth man his due. And this is a main ground why we are ſo ſlow in works of holineſs; for were they of another nature, and did they ſerve our turns more, as we think, we ſhould not then account them tedious: If I were to ſit and tell money all day long, this is for my ſelf (ſaith a man) and for my profit; and if it were for another, we ſhould not think the time long, it may be, at that work neither: but (mind you) when it cometh to any thing which doth concern the Lord, then it's ſo far above a mans reach, whatſoever we have to do in the things of God, that we ſhould ſoon be weary of reaching forth our hands all the day long unto the Lord, and to be conſtantly for God, from God, and with God, in all our Actions: our baſe ſpirits are ſoon ready to be withdrawing from the Lord; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle biddeth us <hi>follow after Peace, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without which no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> ſo that great is the neceſſity of Holineſs, and worthy

Therefore in the Covenant of Grace the Lord giveth the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to <hi>keep</hi> ſtrong poſſeſſion in his ſervants, againſt the ſtrong man armed. This is the firſt ground why the <hi>Holy Ghoſt dwelleth</hi> in us.</p>

It's the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that <hi>acteth</hi> the gifts given to us, and enableth them in us: for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> who keepeth poſſeſſion, doth derive continued ſtrength into our faith, which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth life into all the gifts of God. And if
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170568:66"/>you ſhall ask how <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and the reſt of the gifts of God do work? The <hi>Holy Ghoſt ſtirreth</hi> up faith to look unto Chriſt, who returneth ſtrength by his Spirit unto Faith; and ſo <hi>faith worketh by love,</hi> and by meekneſs, and by all the reſt of the fruits of the Spirit. Thus the Spirit of God <hi>acteth</hi> according to what we read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſons of God:</hi> come to any holy duty, and it is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that leadeth you along, and <hi>atteth</hi> in you: ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and you ſhall keep my judgements, and do them.</hi> And, <hi>holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> It is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God that <hi>moveth</hi> us to any good work, and that <hi>acteth</hi> the gifts of his grace in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

<pb n="810" facs="tcp:170568:67"/>honor his grace unto us, by all the rich and gracious gifts which he hath given us.</p>
               <p>He doth alſo <hi>reveal</hi> unto us the duties which he helpeth us to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my conſcience alſo bearing me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the holy Ghoſt, That I have great heavineſs, and continual ſorrow in mine heart: For I could wiſh that my ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for my Brethren, my Kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> that wrought in him this bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly-love, the ſame <hi>Holy Ghoſt beareth</hi> him <hi>witneſs</hi> that he doth not lie; and that he had continual ſorrow in his heart, and that he could have wiſhed to have been accurſed from Chriſt, that they might be ſaved; it grieved him ſo much that the whole Nation ſhould be deſtitute of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee how great need there is of the Holy Ghoſt to <hi>dwell</hi> in us, to <hi>keep</hi> all the gifts of his grace in us, to <hi>act</hi> them according to his will, and to <hi>diſcover</hi> to us what gracious gifts the Lord hath wrought in us, and what duties he hath helped us to do, that we may be able to give account of them by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> that <hi>dwelleth in us,</hi> and beareth witneſs with us. So there is neceſſity both of the <hi>gifts</hi> of grace, that we may be fit Temples for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to dwell in, and fit inſtruments for him to work by: there is need alſo the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhould dwell in us, for the cauſes we have ſpoken unto.</p>
               <p>And I might add this, to comfort us in all the changes that may come upon us: it is a ſtrong Scripture which we read in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170568:67"/>you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me,</hi> (our Divines have no place of more clear evidence to prove the proceſſion of the Spirit from the Father) both of what mighty redemption he hath wrought for us, and what grace he hath wrought in us. This the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhall teſtifie, even he that proceedeth from the Father; this is the comfort of Gods people. Thus we ſee both theſe points open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us.</p>
               <p>How may we then <hi>imploy</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> this <hi>Sanctification</hi> which the Lord hath given us, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>3</label> and which he keepeth and acteth in us by his Spirit, and whereunto he beareth witneſs? How, or to what end ſhall we imploy it, ſeeing the Lord undertaketh to do theſe things for us?</p>
               <p>If ſo be it, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit giveth us theſe gifts: it is our part then firſt to ſee that we do not reſt in any ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which doth ſpring from Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto us by his bleſſed Spirit. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit knitteth us unto Chriſt, and Chriſt unto us; he worketh faith in us to receive whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord giveth unto us, and by the ſame faith worketh all our holineſs for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Chriſt is made unto us of God, wiſ. dom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption:</hi> therefore we are to ſee him prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal author of all theſe things in us, and for us. This is the principal comfort of all, and the glory of all our ſafety; and ſo far as any of theſe lieth in our Sanctification, we ought to ſee that it be ſanctification in Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170568:68"/>and then it is ſanctification in Jeſus Chriſt, when the Lord giveth us to look unto the Lord Jeſus in it, and to it in him; and as we look for our holineſs to be <hi>perfect</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo we look for continual <hi>ſupply</hi> of it from him: and this it is to make Chriſt our ſanctification, when as whatſoever gift the Lord giveth us, we go not forth in the ſtrength of it, but in the ſtrength of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There may be a change in the ſoul, which may ſpring from a ſpirit of <hi>Bondage,</hi> and may captivate our conſciences unto the <hi>Law,</hi> that may reſtrain us from ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us unto duties: but ſuch holineſs ſpringeth not from <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for there may be a conſcience of duty, without ſence of our need of Jeſus Chriſt: as it was with the Iſraelites at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Deut. 5.27. <hi>Go thou neer</hi> (ſay they to <hi>Moſes) and hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeak thou unto us, all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it, and do it: they have well ſaid, all that they have ſpoken, ſaith the Lord; O that there were an heart in them, that they would fear me!</hi> and ſo forth. This I ſay, therefore, is the firſt thing to be attended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; as ever you would make a right uſe of your holineſs, ſee that it be ſuch as floweth from Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; that there be not only an heart awed with the <hi>Law,</hi> but waiting upon Jeſus Chriſt to be all in all in us, and to us: ſo ſhall we neither neglect the gifts of God in us, nor Chriſt, and his Spirit; but ſhall give their due honour unto all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:170568:68"/>
               <p n="2">2. This may alſo teach all Chriſtians not to <hi>truſt</hi> upon the gifts of their <hi>Holineſs:</hi> though they do ſpring from the <hi>Holy Gboſt</hi> himſelf, though they be ſuch as are unchangeable, though they ſpring from Jeſus Chriſt, and knit your ſouls in Union with him; yet <hi>truſt</hi> not in the gifts themſelves: the Lord layeth it down as the Apoſtacy of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 16.14, 15. <hi>Thy renown went forth among the Heathen, for thy beauty; for it was perfect through my comelineſs which I had put upon thee, ſaith the Lord God. But thou didſt truſt in thine own beauty, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt the Harlot,</hi> &amp;c. Truſt not therefore in any of theſe; but let all our confidence be in Jeſus Chriſt, not in any of the gifts of his Spirit, whatſoever. For a little further open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Truſt not in any <hi>gifts</hi> that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for the <hi>performance</hi> of any duty, for it is not the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian that is able to put forth a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>But our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is of God. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15.5. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cannot onely not do any great matter by his own ſtrength and grace, but nothing at all without Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore he giveth us to underſtand, that <hi>it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.12. if therefore we have any new work to do, look to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt afreſh by Faith, that he may carry an end our works in us, and for us; otherwiſe it is not any ſtrength or grace in us, that can produce any good work, word, or thought: And therefore (mind
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170568:69"/>you) the Apoſtle maketh it a Principle of Chriſtian Religion, that <hi>The juſt man liveth by his Faith;</hi> and he often mentioneth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God;</hi> where he putteth it into his own experience: why? did he not live by Love, and Patience, and Zeal? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yes truly, they were lively in him, if ever in any man, beſides our bleſſed Saviour; and yet notwithſtanding, he never attributed life to any of theſe gifts of his; but if he ſpeak of his <hi>Life,</hi> he maketh this his Univerſal Life, <hi>I live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>I am I am able to do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.13. This is the true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a Chriſtian ſpirit, that when gifts are at the higheſt, the heart is then at the loweſt: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9, 10. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth himſelf to be as one born out of due time; for (ſaith he) <hi>I am leſs then the leaſt of the Apoſtles, not meet to be called an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God; I, but by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace which was beſtowed upon me was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God in me.</hi> This is truly ſpiritual ſanctification, that when the ſoul is full of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet he is like a man in great penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as having nothing of himſelf: This is a marvelous ſpiritual poverty, and you ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find (and I deſire the Lord would open the hearts of his people to know what I ſpeak) that if Chriſtians have fallen, their greateſt falls have been in their moſt exemplary gifts. If
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170568:69"/>you ſhall mark the ſins of all the ſervants of God, they have been chiefly found in the very exerciſe of their beſt gifts. Let us take a little taſte of them, that we may learn to uſe our gifts in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> a man full of <hi>faith,</hi> none went beyond him in Old nor New Teſtament: yet if you read of any failing in him, it is in want of the acting of <hi>faith.</hi> What made him afraid not once, but the ſecond time, that his wife would be taken away from him by <hi>Pharaoh? Gen.</hi> 12. by <hi>Abimelech? chap.</hi> 20. had not the Lord promiſed that he would bleſs him whereſoever he came? <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. He had ſo much of the knowledge and grace of God ſhining in him, that <hi>Sarah</hi> needed not have diſſembled; and <hi>Abimelech</hi> (a poor Heathen) could ſay as much, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Behold, thy husband it a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee, and with all other; thus ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Thou needeſt no ſhifts and lies for thy protections, and to be a vail unto thee: this a poor Heathen can diſcern, that ſuch a man as hath God with him, needeth no other ſhifts nor covering to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and ſhelter him. Thus we ſee that theſe great failings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were proper acts of unbelief. <hi>Moſes,</hi> a meek man, <hi>none like him for meekneſs on the face of the earth;</hi> there is but one ſin ſtoried of him after he was called to the Government of that State, and this was his failing; <hi>Hear now you rebels, Muſt we fetch you water out of this rock? ſo he lift up his hand, and with his rod he ſmote the rock twice, Numb.</hi> 20.10, 11. they provoked <hi>Moſes,</hi> as meek as
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170568:70"/>he was: ſometimes, when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> dealt as peremptorily with him, he was not moved from the meekneſs of his ſpirit: but now he falleth into <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and this was the very ſin, for which the Lord excluded him out of <hi>Canaan, Numb.</hi> 27.12, 13, 14. It was the breach of this royal grace, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye believed me not, to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Iſrael, therefore you ſhall not bring this congregation into the Land which I have given them:</hi> which words ſhew us the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his failing in the grace wherein he ſo much abounded, <hi>becauſe ye believed me not.</hi> The Lord will have him know, that he muſt live by his fiath in his <hi>meekneſs.</hi> If any man think himſelf to be a meek man, and nothing ſhall over-wraſtle him there, if you believe not in God but in your meekneſs, your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will ſoon fail you. <hi>Peter,</hi> a man full of <hi>courage;</hi> and you read of two of his principal failings, and both in point of <hi>courage;</hi> he fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>high Prieſts hall</hi> at the voice of a Damſel, and in the <hi>porch</hi> at the ſpeech of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maid; and the third time, at the voice of one that ſtood by, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.69. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas afterward when he lived by faith, he became undaunted. Another failing of his in point of courage we read of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>He feared thoſe of the circumciſion;</hi> and whereas before he did eat with the Gentiles, when certain of the Circumciſion came from <hi>James,</hi> he withdrew, and ſeparated himſelf, and <hi>ſo diſſembled, and others likewiſe with him, inſomuch, that Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas alſo was carried away with their diſſimuluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s moſt eminent
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170568:70"/>gifts did not bring forth their fruits. Know therefore, that the beſt of all your gifts, faith, meekneſs, courage, wiſdom, love to your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, will fail, if you <hi>truſt</hi> in them; and you will be moſt apt to fail there wherein you do moſt excel. If a man be <hi>wiſe,</hi> he ſhall fail in that point, and it may be in nothing ſo much, as in that, even in thoſe things wherein he thinketh he walketh moſt wiſely: and ſuch an one will find moſt trials in point of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the like will be found in all other graces, and all to this end, to teach the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God to know, that no man liveth by his wiſdom, nor by any thing in himſelf, but by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath given unto his people; and who is only able to give new ſupplies of his <hi>Spirit</hi> unto his ſervants to act every gift which he hath given them. I might have mentioned the example of <hi>Sarab,</hi> a meek and a quiet godly ſpirited woman, ſubject and obedient to her husband, and <hi>called him Lord; whoſe daughters you are while you do well,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. and yet you know one of her greateſt failings, was in point of <hi>Reverence</hi> to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.5. <hi>When ſhe ſaw that ſhe was deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the eyes of her maid, whom ſhe had given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her husband, ſhe ſaid to Abraham, My wrong be upon thee, and the Lord judge between me and thee.</hi> Where is the <hi>reverence</hi> of <hi>Sarah</hi> now? Will you have the daughters of <hi>Sarah</hi> to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate her herein? What had her husband done? There was no fault in him in this matter; ſhe had no reaſon to tax him upon this point; it was her own counſel, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. that <hi>he ſhould go in to her maid, that I may obtain children by her:</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:170568:71"/>therefore there was no colour of any juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint on her part; yet ſee, this meek-ſpirited woman failed in the point of her <hi>meekneſſe</hi> herein, and did expreſs no greater failing all her life long, that we read of: ſhe was weak in faith once, but there was great reaſon, for that her womb was dead, and <hi>her Lord</hi> (as ſhe called him) <hi>was old alſo;</hi> nor doth the Angel ſo much blame her about it: but that action wherein ſhe moſt failed, was againſt that grace wherein ſhe moſt abounded. And though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very grace of the Spirit be of great force, when the Lord doth act and move it, yet let a man go forth in the ſtrength of his greateſt gifts, and if ever his heart fail him, it will be in them.</p>
               <p>Think not when you have done all you can, that you are worthy of any thing, but ſay, that you are unprofitable ſervants: for though <hi>Sanctification</hi> be the way wherein the Lord will pour out all his bleſſings upon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yet he doth require them to boaſt in none of their excellencies, but look at them all as freely given them of God: and conſider that the right unto all ſpringeth from fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo not only the <hi>gift</hi> it ſelf is grace, but the <hi>bleſſing</hi> that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon it is grace alſo. And ſuppoſe that we have attained all that we pray for, ſhall we then exalt our own gifts? No, but let us ſay with <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>I am leſs then the least of all the mercies and truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do not truſt upon <hi>gifts,</hi> nor upon duties performed by thoſe gifts, to reach the bleſſing;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170568:71"/>ſo look not for your juſtification from thence at all: for the Apoſtle is plain, that he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for any thing for his righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his converſion; and after his converſion, he <hi>counteth it all, as droſs, and dung, that he might win Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8. And for our <hi>faith;</hi> they are not to be truſted upon, as grounds of it: for all the gifts of our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are <hi>fruits</hi> of our <hi>faith;</hi> and therefore <hi>faith</hi> is ſaid to <hi>work by love, Gal.</hi> 5.6. And ſo it doth by all other gifts of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and if they be fruits of faith, then <hi>faith</hi> is not built upon them. And thus much for the ſecond <hi>Uſe</hi> which Chriſtians are to make of their ſanctification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is in the next place, a point of <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which this <hi>Sanctification</hi> doth yield, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God by it. The <hi>water</hi> beareth witneſs to the <hi>bloud,</hi> and the <hi>bloud</hi> to the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> unto both, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8. A mans <hi>own ſpirit</hi> beareth witneſs alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit of God beareth witneſs with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God;</hi> and therefore as a witneſſe of God unto our faith, we may lawfully hear what it ſpeaketh: but this is the life of a true evidence, that all theſe gifts of God do not bear witneſs any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a man ſeeth the Lord Jeſus working them in him, and for him: for it is <hi>faith</hi> that maketh all the graces of the Goſpel active, and it is a condition ſo requiſite, that unleſſe our works be of faith, and flow from it, they are not acceptable before God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. for <hi>without faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs faith carry an end our works, they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170568:72"/>are not works of holineſs, ſuch as ſhould bear witneſs to the ſoul. Therefore the Apoſtle doth ſtir up the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto this mainly, <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you are in the faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. if he do exhort them to exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it is in point of faith: and therefore ſome of our Divines, as Reverent <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> by name, who hath written a Sermon upon it, wherein he noteth this, that <q>
                     <hi>unleſs men find faith in their holineſs, none of all their Sanctification will become a ſound witneſs of the grace of God unto them:</hi>
                  </q> but if faith be found, then you ſhall ſee Jeſus Chriſt accepting you, and breathing in you, except you be reprobates. There is a marvelous gracious witneſs, that ſanctification giveth unto him that liveth by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, if it be <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>from</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>for</hi> Chriſt. This only is that ſanctification which the Lord commendeth unto his children, to ſeek after it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth <hi>Uſe</hi> of our ſanctification is, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God helpeth us by it in point of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing;</hi> and therefore it is that you ſhall ſee the ſervants of God, rejoycing in their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world;</hi> he rejoyceth at what the Lord doth by him, and with him. Let <hi>every man prove his own work, and ſo ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf, and not in another. Gal.</hi> 6.4. But what is it that maketh the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to rejoyce before God? When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170568:72"/>in his work before the Lord, you ſhall ever find him rejoycing at the Lords <hi>acting</hi> theſe gifts in him, and <hi>bleſſing</hi> him in his work: let us look upon two or three Scriptures for this end, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>I thank Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the miniſtry; who was before a blaſphemer,</hi> &amp;c. this he thanketh God for: ſo that, mind you, as he ſeeth God <hi>giving</hi> him theſe <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>enabling</hi> him unto the work, ſo he bleſſeth God in that behalf. You ſhall find him alſo bleſſing God, that had <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered</hi> this work of the Miniſtry whereſoever he came, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Thanks be to God which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt, and maketh manifeſt the ſavour of his knowledge by us in every place.</hi> The Lord working in him, and for him, maketh him to triumph, and to over-wraſtle all the difficulties which he meeteth withal. The Lord had given him gifts, and taught him to exerciſe thoſe gifts, and doth accept him; and therefore he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf in a marvelous ſtrong ſpeech, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>I am in nothing aſhamed, but that with all boldneſs, as alwaies, ſo now alſo Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death: for to me to live, is Chriſt; and to die, is gain: to me to live, is Chriſt;</hi> as if he had ſaid, I have no life but <hi>from</hi> Chriſt, I put forth no act of life but <hi>for</hi> Chriſt: this is the ſum of all his converſation; and if Chriſt be his life, then death will be his advantage, and Chriſt will be magnified in either. Thus we may ſee how the <hi>Saints</hi> of God have made uſe of their ſanctification; they are careful
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170568:73"/>to ſee that it flow from Chriſt; and yet when they have it, they dare not truſt in their beſt gifts for the leaſt duty, neither do they look for their faith from their beſt gifts, but they expect their beſt gifts to flow from their faith: they make uſe of the teſtimony of their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when they ſee Chriſt in it, and faith in it, and the Spirit of God carrying them along in the waies and duties thereof: thus they ſee their holineſs, and take comfort in it, and from the witneſs of it, as that by which the Lord diſpenſeth comfort unto his people, when they receive it from the hands of Chriſt, and by faith in him, by which they are taught of God, to carry an end their whole converſation in his name.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Furthermore, as we receive it from Chriſt, and truſt not in it, but in Chriſt, and receive the witneſs of it in Chriſt, and in the holy Spirit of Chriſt; and as we receive Joy and Comfort alſo, which the Lord doth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto us, in a ſanctified courſe, by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Spirit:</hi> ſo we <hi>grow up,</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which we have received in his Name: there is <hi>growth</hi> in grace; this ſanctification is not bedrid; Chriſtians are not as weak now, as they were ſeven years ago, nor do they ſtand at a ſtay, but go forward in Chriſtianity: and hereupon the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Epheſians, Epheſ.</hi>

And many ſweet means the Lord hath appointed for this end; the communion of Gods people tendeth hereunto, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that walketh with the wiſe ſhall learn wiſdom:</hi> all the Ordinances of God are appointed for this end alſo, to beget and encreaſe faith and holineſs; therefore a Chriſtian in the uſe of all theſe Ordinances doth not ſtand at a ſtay, but is ſtill thriving and growing; and that not in his own ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeking for his acceptance and help in every duty he goeth about: and this is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth exhort the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> unto, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him, rooted and built up in him, and ſtabliſhed in the faith.</hi> This ought Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians mainly to attend unto; that as you ſee the branch, the more juice it ſucketh from the root, the more fruitful it is: ſo alſo it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people of God, to know, that the more need we ſtand in to be fruitful, the more need we have to derive a continual freſh ſupply from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that by his Spirit, renewing grace in us, we may be enlarged, and carried an end in the waies of God: whereas otherwiſe the hearts of Chriſtians would ſoon fail to go on in thoſe things, wherein they deſire to be growing up unto perfection. What is the reaſon that ſo many ſervants of God, are not ſo lively in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as they were wont to be many years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go? Truly, we attend upon Ordinances, but it is only upon the outward act of them, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170568:74"/>not upon <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> in them. This is many times wanting in the hearts of Gods people: but truly if this be our conſtant frame, and we do not recover our ſelves, then is not our ſanctification that which floweth from fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, and the Spirit of his grace; for you ſhall ever find this to be true, that there is no gift of Jeſus Chriſt, nor ſanctification accompanying ſalvation, but it doth knit us neerer and neerer unto Chriſt; for the more we are filled with true ſpiritual gifts, the more empty we are of our own ſtrength, and of ſelf-conceits, and ſo we ought to be; otherwiſe you ſhall conſtantly find this, that if the Lord do not preſerve this emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty frame in us, the more full we are of any gift, the more full ſhall we be of our own ſtrength, and conſequently we ſhall feel the leſs need of Jeſus Chriſt; and if this be our conſtant frame, it will be a ſad argument that our beſt ſanctification will not endure, but fall away, unleſs we be knit unto Jeſus Chriſt by the Spirit of his grace; for by all true ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are the more knit unto him: ſo that if any man would know whether the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Chriſt and his image be ſtamped upon his ſanctification, this you ſhall ever find to be the ſtamp of the grace of Jeſus Chriſt; That the more you receive from him, the more need you ſtand in of him: inſomuch, that notwithſtanding all the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, there is not the ableſt Miniſter of the New Teſtament, but (if your gifts flow from the Spirit of Chriſt, and knit you unto Chriſt) you will find as great need to cleave unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170568:74"/>Chriſt, as ever you did the firſt day, when you came trembling into the Pulpit. If therefore we feel our ſelves full, ſo that the more we have received, the more ſufficient we are; and go not about the duties we have in hand, in fear and trembling, but in ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; if this be our uſual, and conſtant practice, it is but counterfeit Chriſtianity: I do not ſay, That the gifts are counterfeit, for they are from the Spirit of God, and men may by them be very ſerviceable to Church &amp; Commonwealth: but this is certain, that the ſtronger and the more your gifts are, if you ſit looſe from Chriſt, the emptier your hearts are of him. But you will ſay, May not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be ſometimes full of himſelf, and depend upon the ſtrength of his own gifts? Yes, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, God forbid I ſhould deny that, for the beſt Chriſtians have gone aſtray in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their beſt gifts; and hereupon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> hath been wanting in <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>courage,</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> in her <hi>modeſty;</hi> they have been ſo apt to truſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe graces of God, wherein they have moſt abounded, that they have principally failed therein: but this you ſhall find, that if they have been overtaken once, or twice, as the burnt child dreadeth the fire; ſo they grow to be more ſenſible of their need of Jeſus Chriſt, more fearful of departing from him, more careful to cleave unto him, that they might grow up in his name to all well pleaſing in his ſight. If therefore there be a ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſtandeth at a ſtay in any man, it is a great ſuſpicion whether it flow from fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170568:75"/>with Chriſt, or no: if gifts be truly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, a man ſhall ordinarily grow up in them: <hi>Habenti dabitur,</hi> Imploy them, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply them; but if you have received gifts in your own ſtrength, and you are now full of your own ſanctification, truly this is but froa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy work, and doth not convey true nor lively nouriſhment and comfort: but to him that in his moſt ſpiritual gifts is empty of himſelf, and only full of Jeſus Chriſt; to live, or die, is his advantage. This is the Uſe which I would commend unto you touching your Chriſtian <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Thus we ſee ſundry things have been clear'd from this Doctrine concerning the Covenant of Grace. There remaineth another thing to be reſolved, and cleared from the Doctrine: For if God in the Covenant of his Grace, do give himſelf to be <hi>a God</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, It is then to be enquired, 1. How God the <hi>Father</hi> giveth himſelf. 2. How God the <hi>Son</hi> giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 3. How God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: For theſe are the Fundamentals of the Covenant of Grace, and neceſſary to be opened for clearing the Doctrine of it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The firſt Act of God, is by <hi>Giving his own Son</hi> out of his boſom, for the redemption of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and his ſeed. That is the firſt and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental of all the reſt, that God doth put
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170568:75"/>forth, or any other perſon in Trinity, for the applying of the Covenant unto the hearts of his people. And God in giving his Son doth give <hi>himſelf,</hi> Joh. 9.14. and 10.30. <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father;</hi> and, <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> if God giveth us his Son, he giveth us <hi>himſelf</hi> alſo: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.23. <hi>He that hath the Son hath the Father, and he that hath not the Son hath not the Father.</hi> Herein hath God <hi>commended his love towards us, that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us;</hi> Rom. 5.8. this is <hi>the love of God to ſend us his Son, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, might not periſh but have everlaſting life. Joh.</hi> 3.16. As God giveth us his Son, ſo he giveth us all things elſe <hi>in</hi> his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. for, <hi>he that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> So then this is the firſt and the great work of God, that he hath given his Son out of his own boſom, to take our nature upon him, to lead a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, and to die a curſed death; and in him hath given all his <hi>attributes,</hi> his <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> unto the ſons of men; an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſign that God intendeth to give <hi>himſelf</hi> in the Covenant of Grace unto his people, when he giveth Jeſus Chriſt himſelf in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as he doth ſay expreſly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and will give thee for a Covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.</hi> Wherein we may ſee, that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth another, even that God the Father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God the Son; thus it is a gift of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170568:76"/>that the Lord giveth Chriſt to be the foundation of the Covenant, and the chief bleſſing of it; in <hi>chap.</hi> 49.8. He ſpeaketh to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of ſalvation have I helped thee, and will preſerve thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, Joh.</hi> 1.18. nor can ſee him, nor will God the Father have immediate fellowſhip with any creature, <hi>but the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of the Father,</hi> the Lord hath given him that he might <hi>reveal him.</hi> Thus we may perceive that the Lord is gracious, and marvelous gracious, in that he giveth us his dear Son, the ſecond perſon in Trinity; and thus he ſaith to his elect, <hi>I will be a God unto thee, and give thee my Son,</hi> that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thee out of all diſtreſs, and danger: This doth the Lord for his people, and it is a clear evidence of his grace, and ſheweth that his love unto his people is beyond all banks, and bottoms, for the Lord to give us his Son, and this Son ſo ſoon as he was promiſed; not the Lord only, but his people ſaw him afar off, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.5, 6. <hi>Your father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> For when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.16, 17. and <hi>the Lord had ſaid unto him, I will bleſs Sarah, and give thee a ſon of her; yea, I will bleſs her, and ſhe ſhall be a mother of many nations, kings of people ſhall be of her; then Abraham fell upon his face, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> he did rejoyce that the Lord would give him a Saviour out of his loynes: how it could be brought to paſſe, it may be he knew not;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170568:76"/>but by a Spirit of Prophecie did he diſcern it much, no doubt. This is the firſt work of God in giving himſelf by Covenant; and this was done long ago, before we were born: he gave him in his eternal Counſel, when he did elect us in him; he gave him when he ſent him into the world: but this is more, when he giveth <hi>us</hi> unto his Chriſt, by Covenant, and draweth <hi>us</hi> unto him, and giveth <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto <hi>us</hi> alſo: and this grace of God cometh neerer unto us; the other did leave us like Lambs in a large paſture: but now as he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>us</hi> unto Chriſt, ſo he giveth <hi>him</hi> to us, and both in preſent poſſeſſion; and this the Father doth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>for no man,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>can come unto me, except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him: and every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Now this <hi>hearing,</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a ſtrange kind of learning, which the Lord teacheth the ſoul by, when he draweth him unto Chriſt; an effectual Teaching, and powerful, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This is our effectual calling, and this is the Lords giving <hi>us</hi> unto his Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me:</hi> all this is properly the work of the Father. Men are ſaid to be well given, when they give themſelves to their Books, to their Works, and buſineſs: but this we may well ſay, that we are indeed well given, when the Lord giveth us unto his Son; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are but in an ill ſtate, which way ſoever we are given.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In a word; The Lord draweth us unto his Son by his Spirit, and calleth us as by his Word, ſo by his Spirit alſo, and giveth us by his Word and Spirit unto Jeſus Chriſt. In this thing I ſhall ſpeak no more unto you, then what you have often heard, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe long ago received, as, that the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his people out of their ſins, by the light of the <hi>Law,</hi> and by the ſpirit of <hi>bondage</hi> he ſetteth home the <hi>Law</hi> effectually unto the ſoul, and thereby draweth us from ſin, and from the world in ſome meaſure, that we have now no might to thoſe things, which before we were full of delight in: whether they be ſins againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> or ſins againſt the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> it is the Lords uſual dealing by his Spirit, to ſet home ſins againſt both; Inſomuch that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we come to be afflicted with ſome kind of trembling, and fear, and torment about our ſpiritual eſtate: and thus it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> (who afterwards was <hi>Paul) Act.</hi> 9.3, 4, 5, 6. when Jeſus Chriſt called unto him out of heaven, he all <hi>trembling,</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſhed,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> So it was with the <hi>Jaylor, Act.</hi> 16.29. after the Lord had ſhaken his heart with an earthquake, (which is a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law, and a ratification of it) as all Gods Judgements are) <hi>he called for a light, and ſprang in, and came trembling to Paul and Silas.</hi> Thus the Lord draweth men out of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170568:77"/>themſelves, and their ſinful waies, by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage, whereby they are greatly and deeply afflicted with fear; concerning which, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear, or bondage; but of power, of love, and of a ſound mind,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch fear alſo the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. when he ſaith, <hi>Perfect love caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out fear, for fear hath torment;</hi> which cometh from the ſence of a mans ſtate, whereby he is many times forced to cry out, and to ſay, Wo worth my ſoul, that ever I was born; for the Lord cauſeth me to poſſeſs all my ſins, and preſſeth me down to the nethermoſt hell: this is one work of the ſpirit of <hi>bondage,</hi> by which the Lord draweth the ſoul out of itſelf, and its ſins, though of it ſelf the ſpirit of fear goeth no further then to ſhake a mans carnal confidence: but there is a further act of the ſpirit of <hi>bondage,</hi> according to that power which was given to the faithful witneſſes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Beſides this ſpirit of bondage, the Lord hath another work, which is called a ſpirit <hi>of burning,</hi> Mal. 4.1. <hi>The day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of hoſts; and it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi> This is a ſpirit of <hi>burning;</hi> let us ſpeak unto it a little. The Prophet ſaith, <hi>It ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi> There are two things in the root.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt is the root of <hi>Abraham's Covenant,</hi> which this people much truſted upon; and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170568:78"/>that is it of which <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Now the ax is laid to the root of the tree,</hi> &amp;c. and this he ſpake (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9.) after he had ſaid, <hi>Think not to ſay with your ſelves, We have Abraham to our father,</hi> ver. 8. So that all the confidence that they had in <hi>Abraham's Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and ſuch things, is burnt up; and ſo they have no root left them to ſtand upon. And this is one thing intended by the <hi>root.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is ſomething more in it: for with this ſpirit of <hi>burning,</hi> the Lord by the power of his Spirit doth cut us off, from any power of our own natural gifts, or parts, and ſpiritual gifts alſo, whereby we thought to lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt; and we are cut off hereby from all that confidence that we have in our own ſufficiency, when once the Lord intendeth to bring a ſoul unto himſelf; for there is an uſual prefidence that we have of our own ſtate: though the Lord have cut us off from hope in the righteouſneſs of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and from boaſting of his Ordinances, yet we think there is ſome power ſtill left us, and therefore we hope, and will ſeek, that the Lord may reveal himſelf to us in mercy and peace; but when the Lord cometh neerer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, he will ſhew us how unable we are to take up the leaſt good reſolution; we ſhall be like bruiſed reeds, and not find our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold up our heads; for <hi>Chriſt came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> So that Chriſt will not ſeek us until we be <hi>loſt;</hi> and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170568:78"/>me;</hi> and according hereunto it is, that thoſe converts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. do cry out, when they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Men, and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Hence it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the poor ſouls that came unto Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. were like bruiſed reeds that could not hold up their heads; for the Lord in this caſe bruiſeth them, and layeth them low, that they ſee no more hope of mercy, no likelihood that God ſhould ſhew them any hope. Thus doth the Lord burn up the root of <hi>Abraham's Covenant</hi> wherein men truſt, and the root of all our <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency;</hi> that now we find our ſelves dried up, and our ſtrength conſumed; that now we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think, as of our ſelves, a good thought.</p>
               <p>And again, The Lord by this ſpirit of <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> doth burn up all our branches alſo, how fair and green ſoever they have been; all our <hi>faſtings,</hi> and <hi>humiliations,</hi> and <hi>alms-deeds,</hi> and <hi>prayers;</hi> ſuch things as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees much boaſted in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but theſe things are all burnt up. This is a ſpirit of <hi>bondage,</hi> partly as it worketh a <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and partly as it worketh to the burning up of all the <hi>hope</hi> that we have in our ſelves. There is a ſpirit of <hi>bondage,</hi> I confeſs, that only worketh unto <hi>fear;</hi> and now all the hope is, that a man ſetteth upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: but if the Lord love a mans ſoul, he will not let him ſtay there; but goeth further with him, and ſheweth him that his prayers &amp; faſtings are all empty, and fall ſhort of the life and power of Jeſus Chriſt. I, but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170568:79"/>yet, the ſoul is not quite out of hope, though the <hi>Law</hi> cannot ſave me; if it cannot, I muſt get me to Jeſus Chriſt then, and lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for ſalvation: as if all were to be had by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, if once he can lay hold upon him, and nothing elſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired but faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and my lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon him. I ſee plainly (ſaith a man in this caſe) that there is no hope in me, as hath been rightly obſerved; &amp; therefore he truſteth upon Jeſus Chriſt, and giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt: but now if the Lord love thy ſoul, he will not ſuffer thee there to reſt, the ſpirit of <hi>burning</hi> will not leave thee ſo. How comeſt thou by faith in Jeſus Chriſt? Why? Thou tookeſt it up of thy own accord; thou thoughteſt, all thy gifts and duties were in vaine, and therefore now thou wilt believe in Jeſus Chriſt; Is it ſo eaſie a matter? Can any man <hi>come unto Chriſt, except the Father draw him?</hi> And is thy faith any more then a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thine own, when thou waſt convinced of the emptineſs of thine own gifts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? When this ſpirit of <hi>burning</hi> hath blaſted this thy faith alſo, and that by the clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Goſpel put upon it; now, ſaith the ſoul, I ſee that I am not in Chriſt: though I ſaid, I would truſt in Chriſt; yet I ſee it is <hi>not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven:</hi> now I ſee it is not my faith that will reach Jeſus Chriſt, it is not a faith of my own undertaking that will ſerve the turn; I ſee now Chriſt alone muſt work this great work in me, and Chriſt in the way of his own Ordinances; therefore I
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170568:79"/>muſt look for it in his word, and in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Sacraments; therefore I will look up unto the Lord in all theſe, and wait for him, and ſeek him therein. And ſo the poor ſoul maketh account, that in time he ſhall find Jeſus Chriſt in the Ordinances, and ſo hammereth out a faith from thence, and therein bleſſeth himſelf. Now (minde you) the Spirit of God (when the Lord God the Father will draw home the ſoul through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Jeſus Chriſt) will <hi>burn</hi> up all thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: for if thy ſoul be not utterly loſt; ſo long as it hath any root, or power in it ſelf: though I cannot work, I will believe; and if I cannot believe, I will wait that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and ſo here is ſtill the old root of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> left alive in us, whereby men ſeek to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, whereof the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> often maketh mention: This old root putteth forth it ſelf, and will not ſuffer the ſoul to be wholly for Chriſt, and for Chriſt alone; and all becauſe there is a ſpring of <hi>Adam</hi> ſtill in the ſoul: whence it is that the ſoul is marvelous apt to have hope and confidence more or leſs from ſome vertue or power in himſelf; therefore it is no ſmall matter to be cut off from <hi>Adam,</hi> that's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24.) as ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: <hi>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and wert graffed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature into a good olive-tree;</hi> this is marvelous ſtrong work, when the Spirit of God cometh to act contrary things to nature: for nature is fully poſſeſſed, that what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, I am able to do it: nature will
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170568:80"/>not be perſwaded to the contrary: If I hear God command any thing, I will do it, (ſaith a carnal heart) and if I cannot do it, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and if I cannot believe, I will wait that I may believe: this is ſtill but nature. Now when the Lord cometh indeed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft us into Jeſus Chriſt, this is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature. Why wherein is it ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to nature? I anſwer: whereas nature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive for it ſelf, now it cometh to paſſe, that whereas a ſoul hath been ſtirring and buſie in his own ſtrength, at length the Spirit of God by the mighty power of his Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhed abroad into the ſoul, doth <hi>burn up root and branch,</hi> not only the root of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Covenant,</hi> but all the fatneſs of the root of the wild Olive, by which we are fat, and lively to ſpiritual work, in our apprehenſions; ſo that we work in our own ſtrength, untill the Lord come, and cut us quite down, and make us to ſee, that there is not in us the leaſt good thought, as of our ſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs the Lord be wonderfully gracious to us, we cannot be ſaved: till it come unto this, the ſoul is not fit for Jeſus Chriſt. Thus the Spirit of God may work powerfully in the hearts men, and burn up their root and branch: and this a ſpirit of burning may do, and yet leave the ſoul in a damnable condition, for ought I know; and ſuch as many a ſoul may be in, and yet never come to enjoy ſaving fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore as this is one arm of God ſtretched forth for the ſalvation of his people, when he draweth them home to Jeſus Chriſt: ſo</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170568:80"/>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, there is a further work of God, when he giveth the ſpirit of <hi>adoption,</hi> which reacheth beyond all the former work: he hath cut us off from our ſelves, and now we ſtand in a ſtate quite contrary to nature; and if any ſaving-work be wrought in us, it is quite contrary to nature; if any thing fall upon the heart and ſoul of a man, to bring his will to this paſſe, to lie down at Gods feet, that he knoweth not what to do; and yet whatſoever the Lord calleth him unto, he is willing if it were poſſible to be done; he would run through fire and water to do it: but he findeth himſelf unable to do any thing; and now he will tell you, that to believe is as impoſſible for him, as to build a world. Why then bid him <hi>wait:</hi> wait? ſaith he; I but I cannot wait; and if I ſeek the Lord, I cannot find him: and I ſee others of the ſervants of God wrought upon graciouſly; but dead hearted I, nothing will work upon me. Now in ſuch a caſe as this, the Spirit of adoption cometh into the heart of a Chriſtian, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth poſſeſſion of the ſoul for Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo draweth the ſoul unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it there to ſtay, and there to lie down, and to be willing to be drawn yet neerer and neerer to Jeſus Chriſt, and to be carried an end by him, to take all from him, and to give all the glory to him. This ſpirit of <hi>Adoption</hi> doth give a man a ſon-like frame, to lie proſtrate at his Fathers will: like unto the Prodigal ſon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17, 18, 19. who when he came unto himſelf, and ſaw how unable he was to provide for himſelf,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170568:81"/>and how unworthy he was that his father ſhould do any thing for him; he came and lay down as it were at the feet of his father; for he is unable, and unworthy of any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: now this ſtooping of the heart unto God, and yielding unto him to do with us as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in his own eyes, is ſuch a proſtration of the heart wherein the Lord hath taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ſoul, that now a man is led un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, that there is none in heaven but him, none in the earth in compariſon of him, that the ſoul deſireth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and now a man waiteth upon Chriſt, to ſee what he will do for him; and though he cannot tell you that he waiteth, yet he doth wait that he may be helped of God to depend upon him: thus he receiveth all from Chriſt, and giveth all unto Chriſt. This is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drawing of the ſoul, which is expounded to be the hearing and learning of the Father of which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.45. <hi>He that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me;</hi> which is, when the Lord hath drawn the ſoul out of his natural corruptions, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal reformations, pretences of faith, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon Chriſt in his own ſtrength for faith if it be wanting: then when the ſoul doth lie at his feet to diſpoſed of according to the will of God, and is in ſome meaſure ſubject unto the Lord, though not ſo much as he could be deſirous he were; and therefore now the ſoul doth not content and bleſs himſelf in his faith, not any other gifts or works of his own; but yieldeth himſelf humbly unto the Lord, to work in him both will and deed, of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170568:81"/>his own good pleaſure, and to teach him how to ſeek, and wait, and believe, and long after Jeſus Chriſt; theſe things he waiteth for: otherwiſe, until he be thus taught of God, the ſoul will alway think that he can do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and is not able to come out of himſelf, to an utter denial of himſelf: but <hi>if any man will come unto Chriſt, he muſt deny himſelf,</hi> even all his own gifts, and parts, and good works whatſoever: for a man is never utterly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until there be nothing left of which a man can ſay, This I am able to do, or this is an excellent thing in me; and when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto this paſſe, then will the ſoul lie down at the will of God, and acknowledge that if the Lord would never ſhew him mercy, juſt and righteous are his judgements. Now when the ſoul and will of a Chriſtian are convinced of theſe things, as well as his judgement, that now he waiteth upon Chriſt, as well that he may be able to wait, and ſeek the Lord, as he doth for any other good thing from the Lord; he waiteth now upon the Lord for a poor ſpirit, and cannot perk up himſelf, as a bruiſed reed cannot do. Thus when it cometh unto ſaving-work, the will and ſoul of a man is ſo caſt down, that a man cannot tell what to make of himſelf; but there he lieth, to ſee what the Lord will do with him, whether he will reach forth the hand of ſalvation unto him. In this caſe the ſoul is left utterly void, and hath in himſelf neither root nor branch; but ſeeth how una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he is to believe, or wait: nor can he tell whether Jeſus Chriſt be his portion; and now
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170568:82"/>doth the Lord take poſſeſſion, and fill the empty ſoul. If you ſhall ask me how this <hi>ſpirit</hi> cometh into the ſoul, to make it thus to ſtoop unto Jeſus Chriſt? You ſhall find that the Lord uſeth to convey himſelf unto the ſoul in ſome <hi>word</hi> of <hi>promiſe</hi> of the Goſpel, that ſheweth unto the ſoul the riches of the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt: ſomething or other is declared of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> This word being taught in the publick Miniſtry of the Word, or brought to remembrance in ſome ſpiritual duty, as prayer, or conference, or the like (for I will not limit the holy One of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, yet) uſually it is done in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and though the Lord doth not limit himſelf, yet he doth limit us to attend upon the means, which he uſually worketh by: but whatſoever the way be, this is the manner of Gods working, he doth univerſally come into the ſoul, in ſome word or other of his grace: as for inſtance, that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf;</hi> or that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of which I am chief.</hi> In ſome ſuch word of Gods grace, he cometh and putteth life into the ſoul, and maketh it ſomwhat quiet, and cauſeth it to ſee that there is hope in Iſrael; and the Lord is able to ſave me, and there is riches enough in Jeſus Chriſt to ſave me. By ſuch kind of work it is, that the Lord bringeth the ſouls of his ſervants effectually to Jeſus Chriſt. And now hath God the <hi>Father</hi> given us unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and until now, thou never cameſt home ſavingly. This is the ſecond act where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170568:82"/>God the Father giveth <hi>himſelf</hi> unto the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third <hi>Act</hi> or work of God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> which followeth both theſe: So ſoon as ever the Lord hath given this <hi>ſelf-denying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> unto the ſoul, and hath made it like unto a bruiſed reed, or like a Traveller that is out of his way, and willing to take any man by the hand that will lead him into his way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; when the ſoul is in ſuch a frame, now God the Father cometh by a third work of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual <hi>reconcilement:</hi> The firſt work, was of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction:</hi> The ſecond, was a work of <hi>ſubjection:</hi> And the third, of <hi>reconciliation.</hi> This is the third work of the Father: though there is in all theſe works a concurrence of the whole Trinity, yet ſome are more proper unto each perſon, as our <hi>Catechiſms</hi> teach us, and we are not wont to ſcruple ſuch expreſſions in them. God the <hi>Father created</hi> us; and we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, but as God the Father created us at the firſt, ſo he doth again create you, or elſe if we acknowledge it in the one, and not in the other, we do God the Father wrong. Well, he is then reconciled unto us, having given us the Spirit of his Son, and now he doth pronounce us reconciled unto him: this is the work which is ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled unto God, by the death of his Son.</hi> And this is the work of God the <hi>Father,</hi> according to that which is before alledged, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world,</hi> &amp;c. now there are two <hi>acts</hi> of God, as fruits that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hereupon, and both of them done at once upon the ſoul.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:170568:83"/>
               <p n="1">1. Act of God is <hi>Adoption,</hi> whereby he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us his Children; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law; that we might receive the adoption of ſons: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</hi> And <hi>as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God, Joh.</hi> 1.12. So that now we are the <hi>brethren</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>ſons</hi> of the eternal God. <hi>Adoption</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the work of the <hi>Father:</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt being the natural Son of God, we muſt be knit unto him, before we can be accounted ſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Act of God is <hi>Juſtification,</hi> It is <hi>God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. This is the Fathers work, and it is principally attributed unto him to forgive our iniquities, and to reconcile us in Jeſus Chriſt. And look as it is in our natural being; ſo ſoon as ever we have received natural life from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> we become the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his ſin is imputed unto us: ſo it is in the new birth; ſo ſoon as ever the life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſhed abroad into our hearts, ſo ſoon are we <hi>heirs</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the righteouſneſs of the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> is imputed unto us now to our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as was the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> before to our condemnation.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine it ſelf is but an Uſe. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> But I deſire that we may all of us apply it unto our ſelves. It will be helpful unto us for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; to teach us how we came to ſaving fellowſhip with God in Jeſus Chriſt, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170568:83"/>wherein lieth our ſpiritual union with Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; how it is wrought and obtained: and this is neceſſary; for as it hath been obſerved by others, ſo we may now gather it from what we have heard, that there be four ſorts of men, that fall ſhort of this union with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have ſome that bleſs themſelves in their natural ſtate; it may be they are rich, and honourable among men: well, they bleſs themſelves in that ſtate, and will never go any further.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another ſort, that are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the danger of their natural eſtate, they dare not reſt there, and hereupon they fall to reformations, and ſo to duties of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the like; wherein they find ſuch a bleſſed change, and ſo much comfort, as doth ſatisfie them: and indeed the Lord doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort men in their reformations; for God will have no man loſe by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2, 5. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites have their reward for their alms, and for their prayers. Herod when he heard John, reformed many things, and heard him gladly. Mar.</hi> 6.20. here was a great change, and doubtleſs much comfort: yet theſe men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the work of God the <hi>Father,</hi> to burn up all that they have received by any ſtrength of their own.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third ſort go a ſtep beyond theſe: They have been convinced, that they went forth to reformation in their own ſtrength: they plainly ſee it, and diſcern it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they know that it is impoſſible to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the righteouſneſs of the <hi>Law,</hi> and that it is not of works neither, of one kind,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170568:84"/>nor of another: They are convinced, that faith only muſt do the deed, and upon this ground they will take up faith to believe in Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation; and that faith which formerly they have pitched upon their good duties, they will now pitch it upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> but ſtill it is the ſame faith, for the root is not yet <hi>burnt</hi> up, their old corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill remaineth in them: and ſo here is your old faith tranſlated from one object to another; it was faſtened before upon <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>reformations,</hi> and now upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And now a man is ready to plead, and ſay, If God had not loved me, he would never have ſet me upon ſuch reformations, nor have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged me with ſuch comforts as he hath done, if he had not been well pleaſed with me in Jeſus Chriſt: but though he may be ſometimes burnt up touching his hope in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yet he will tranſlate his <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> but how came you to do that, brother? Why, I ſaw my hopes in my own reformation would not ſerve my turn, and therefore I believed in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and now ſhall nothing draw me from Jeſus Chriſt, nor pull me from my confidence: for I have built upon ſome word of God, and ſome <hi>promiſe</hi> of his unto ſuch reformation as I have ſet upon; and is not this true faith in Jeſus Chriſt? This is far from true faith, it is no other but a ſtrong fallacy whereby the Devil doth cheat men; and in truth, this faith is but a faith of a mans own making, that I may ſo ſpeak; it is no more but a ſpirit of <hi>burning</hi> at the beſt, that hath burnt up his confidence in his own
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170568:84"/>works, and taught him to reſolve to believe on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There are a fourth ſort, that fall far ſhort of Jeſus Chriſt alſo, and yet go beyond all theſe: they go beyond <hi>works,</hi> and beyond this <hi>faith</hi> alſo which we have ſpoken of, which was not a lively faith in Jeſus Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are juſtified; but men juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by it, God doth not juſtifie them: now this fourth ſort come plainly to ſee that their faith is ſhaken, and they dare not look God in the face, to juſtifie the truth of their faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: It is true, many an heavenly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man cannot tell what will become of him, nor can he tell whether his faith be ſound: but many an hypocrite alſo is ſo far convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that he cannot tell what will become of him, nor can he ſay that his faith is right, nor that he is able to believe: what faith the ſoul now in ſuch a caſe as this? He will ſay, I ſee it is not my <hi>reformation,</hi> nor my <hi>faith,</hi> that will ſerve the turn: what is it then? I ſee that now I muſt <hi>wait</hi> upon Chriſt that I may believe, and unto him muſt I <hi>ſeek</hi> for help. Is not this ſoul in a ſtate of everlaſting fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt? Truly this is that which the Lord many times bringeth the ſouls of his ſervants unto; but he leaveth them not here, if he mean to do them good. For I would examine again, how cameſt thou to wait upon Jeſus Chriſt? Thou haſt been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of conceit of thy former faith, and ſo haſt been forced, and haſt ſeen a neceſſity to wait upon Jeſus Chriſt for faith, or elſe thou canſt not believe: force of argument hath
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170568:85"/>conſtrained thee thus far. If thou haſt taken up a courſe of waiting only upon this ground, here is a ſpark of <hi>old Adam</hi> ſtill kept alive in thee: thou art <hi>able</hi> to ſeek, and wait upon Jeſus Chriſt, and yet I cannot promiſe thee that thou haſt any part or portion in him. But a ſoul will ſay, Hath not the Lord made gracious promiſes to all thoſe that ſeek for him? Hath he not ſaid, that <hi>all they are bleſſed that wait for him? Iſa.</hi> 30.18. and am not I wrapped up hereby in a bundle of grace and peace? Mind you; there is no promiſe of life made to ſuch as wait and ſeek in their <hi>own ſtrength,</hi> who being driven unto it, have taken it up by their own reſolutions; though I grant it is true, that every one that waiteth for, and ſeeketh the Lord aright, is driven unto it by the Lord: but if ever the Lord mean to ſave you, he will rend as it were the caul from the heart, I mean, he will pluck away all the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that you have built upon, as a man would rend the entrails of a beaſt from him: ſo the Lord will bring you to a flat denial of your ſelves, and that you have neither good will nor deed as of your ſelves; and you know not what God will do with you; but this you know, that whatſoever he doth, he is moſt righteous. When the Spirit of God cometh as a <hi>Comforter,</hi> he will in this manner <hi>convince</hi> the ſoul of a man, that he hath heretofore hung upon his <hi>reformations</hi> for hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; but now he is brought plainly to ſee, and flatly to deny, that he had not ſo much as one drop of the fatneſs of the true Olive in him, when he moſt truſted unto his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170568:85"/>Now a man being thus far brought on, doth not only deny himſelf in his <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but in his <hi>will,</hi> and is ready to ſay, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſometimes did; <hi>If the Lord ſay, he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in me, here I am, let him do unto me as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him good;</hi> the Lord is righteous in all that cometh upon me: this only the ſoul hath for his ſupport in ſuch a caſe, the Lord is <hi>able</hi> to do all for me that I ſtand in need of: If he ſhew me no mercy, he is <hi>juſt;</hi> if he be gracious, I ſhall live to praiſe him. Now when a mans <hi>will</hi> is thus ſubdued, that he hath no <hi>will</hi> of his own to be guided by, but the will of God, this is true <hi>brokenneſs</hi> of heart, when not only the <hi>judgement,</hi> but the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>will</hi> is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The ſoul being thus convinced that neither his working, nor believing, nor wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor ſeeking as of himſelf will do him any good, there is no mercy that he can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge for any goodneſs ſake of his own; then cometh the Holy Ghoſt in ſome declaration of Gods free Love, and taketh poſſeſſion of the heart, and then the ſoul beginneth to pant after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and nothing in heaven but him, nor in the earth beſides him: The ſoul being thus wrought upon, beginneth to put forth it ſelf towards the Lord Jeſus; but the Holy Ghoſt had taken poſſeſſion before, and ſo helpeth our infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. he alone muſt help us, and no other: obſerve it I pray you, for it is moſt neceſſary to know it to be impoſſible, that a <hi>conditional promiſe</hi> ſhould ſave the ſoul. A man is convinced that there is no condition will quiet his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit until the grace of God in Chriſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170568:86"/>to him. This is the firſt Uſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe may give light touching a controverſie, if it be ſtirring in the Country, I know not whether it be, I fear it is, and yet hope that if matters were rightly underſtood, there would be no material difference: for if the Queſtion be not about <hi>grace,</hi> but about the <hi>diſcerning</hi> of grace, you will find that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which tend unto the diſcerning of grace, will be of much leſs dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence then the other; for thereupon lieth the very foundation of a Chriſtian mans ſafe eſtate. How far there is difference in the Country, I cannot give an account; but I deſire that you may all underſtand what I ſay.</p>
               <p>If you demand, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>1</label> upon what grounds cometh the ſoul to cloſe with Chriſt aright; whether upon a <hi>conditional,</hi> or upon an <hi>abſolute promiſe?</hi> And are they not both free?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> It is true, they are both free; but when God is ſaid to do any thing to a work, as to apply a promiſe to a work, it is not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to be a promiſe of grace: but I will not enter into Diſpute: This you will find to be true; that take a ſoul that is in union with Chriſt, and apply all the Promiſes to him, he will make you this anſwer, before the Spirit of Grace cometh into him, he is clear in this, that there are none of all the Promiſes of God belonging unto him, till the Lord who hath broken him do bind him up again; for his heart will tell you that his duties and reformations have been ſuch, as have kept him from Chriſt. You will ſay, I hope you
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170568:86"/>truſt upon <hi>Chriſt:</hi> I, will he ſay, with that faith by which I truſted upon works before. If you tell him of <hi>promiſes</hi> made to faith, he will ſay, But not to mine, that hath only ſprung from my own <hi>reformations.</hi> Conſider, all you that ſearch the word of God this day, when the ſoul cometh, to deny that it hath true faith, what promiſe can it apply unto that which it denieth it ſelf to have? A ſoul will be ready to refuſe promiſes, even when the Spirit of God hath taken poſſeſſion; but then it is his ſin: yet all the time before, there is no reaſon but that the ſoul ſhould refuſe to apply Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; when there was nothing but a power of the ſpirit of Reformation, and till we be cut off from the <hi>old Adam,</hi> we ſhall be ready to quarrel and ſnarle that the Lord ſhould deal thus with us; and why did he ſuffer <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to fall? and put upon us ſuch a <hi>Law</hi> to obey, and then condemn us for that which we were never able to perform? Truly there is nothing to help in this caſe: but the Lord will take away thy crabbed ſpirit, he will make thee to lie flat at his feet, and to ſay, If he will kill me, here I am; and if he will ſave thee, he will make thee content to receive all from Chriſt; and to be willing that he ſhould do with thee, that which is good in his own eyes. And what can help a ſoul now, but only an <hi>abſolute promiſe?</hi> Whereby the ſoul is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to look to the Name of that Chriſt, whom he hath all this while blaſphemed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted. Thus we ſee upon what terms and grounds any one is jealous of building his comfort upon <hi>conditional promiſes,</hi> and why we
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170568:87"/>are ſo loath to ſay, that <hi>ſanctification</hi> is an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of a mans <hi>juſtification;</hi> it is becauſe men may produce ſanctification, and promiſes unto it, when it is but legal righteouſneſs. Yet ſome men will ſay, I have been driven out of my own legal righteouſneſs, and now I reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, and may I not take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſuch faith, and ſanctification flowing therefrom? I confeſs faith in Chriſt, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification flowing from it, are precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but how cameſt thou by them? If thou knoweſt not how, I cannot but think that thou ſtoaleſt them, and cameſt not by them in the right way: you will ſay, Well, though I have no righteouſneſs, nor faith of my own, yet I can <hi>wait</hi> upon Chriſt: How cameſt thou by <hi>power</hi> to wait upon Chriſt? Here is a branch of the <hi>old Adam</hi> ſtill ſpringing forth afreſh; thou art confident in thine own ſtrength, and worth; and if God deal otherwiſe with thee then thou expecteſt, thou wilt be apt to wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with the Lord, ſo far wilt thou be from ſtooping to his will. Search the Scriptures, and ſee if it be not the truth of God. See whether it be thy qualifications taken up upon unjuſt grounds, that will ſave thy ſoul; thou haſt not been drawn far enough all this while: if thou ſayeſt thou haſt been drawn to <hi>reformation,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>waiting;</hi> If thou haſt been indeed drawn, it is a comfortable ſign; but truely the Promiſes do not belong unto thee, until thou art brought unto a flat <hi>denial</hi> of thy ſelf; and thy <hi>will</hi> be made to lie proſtrate before the will of God, and is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſatisfie it ſelf in any thing beſides <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170568:87"/>Chriſt;</hi> the want of either of which, will leave a man ſtill a member of old <hi>Adam;</hi> that either he will cavil with God, or elſe will go away, and be jolly, and frolick, and free of ſpirit, though he knoweth not what the Lord will do for him: which is a plain ſign that the Spirit of God is not there, &amp; then there is no condition of which it can be ſaid, This is the ſpot of Gods children, This is the ſeal of the ſervants of the Living God. If then the Spirit of God come upon the wings of a <hi>promiſe,</hi> it is an <hi>abſolute promiſe;</hi> and then you muſt not wonder, if we be thus afraid that men ſhould build their faith upon <hi>conditional promiſes:</hi> if men build their conſolation upon conditions of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hypocrites have gone beyond it: if you have truſted in your own faith, hypocrites will plead that they have gone beyond that alſo; for they have waited upon God that they might believe. And therefore ſee the reaſon why we do ſo much miſtruſt the building of our faith upon promiſes made unto conditions in us. And I have given you the grounds from the word of God: for I ſhould be a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to the Lord Jeſus, if I ſhould ſpeak from any other grounds. And though it be true (which I have formerly ſaid) that the fruits of the Spirir of grace in the heart of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to be evidences of a good eſtate; yet let it firſt appear from whence they come: firſt draw neer unto God in Jeſus Chriſt, and when any are brought on to Chriſt by ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, ſuch mens faith and love are indeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident tokens of ſalvation and communion</p>

               <p>with Chriſt; but until men be thus brought on, they can have no Evidence from ſuch graces. Therefore you ſee why we are ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to build our faith upon <hi>qualifications;</hi> for any ſelf-denying ſoul will tell you, that no promiſe will ſerve his turn to build his faith upon, but ſome ſuch as ſpeaks of Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and free grace: if there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made unto faith, he will find himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unable to apply it, until the Lord by ſome word of his free grace hath wrought faith in him.</p>
               <p>You may ſee here the unſafeneſs of any ſuch building; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> as when we are convinced of our ſins, then we ſeek for ſome qualification in our ſelves, and think that the Holy Ghoſt applieth ſome promiſe made to ſuch a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and ſo we lay hold upon Jeſus Chriſt: a moſt unſafe building, in my underſtanding; for we cannot reach any gracious qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, until we have firſt received <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Promiſe; and then we muſt look up unto him to bring us unto the promiſes, and to apply them to us. It is not poſſible that a corrupt tree ſhould bring forth good fruit: but firſt make the tree good; and good trees we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, till we be ingrafted into <hi>Chriſt:</hi> which is indeed the ground of my great fear, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, and the reaſon why I dare not be ſo unfaithful, as to ſet men in a way of faith, or any other qualifications, thereby to conclude their ſafe eſtate, before they have received <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a promiſe. Indeed, when a mans ſoul is wounded, and convinced of ſome hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſins, the Promiſes of God in ſuch a caſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170568:88"/>may ſupport his ſoul; but do not lead a man in ſuch a caſe to ſee his faith, or any other qualification, therein to ſatisfie himſelf: but if I would help and comfort ſuch a ſoul, I would declare to him what the Lord hath done for us in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> I would ſhew him all the treaſures of the rich grace of <hi>Christ;</hi> I would ſet in order before him, how he loveth freely without any deſerts in us; <hi>I</hi> would tell him how freely the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth invite men to come to him, that have neither money, nor moneys worth: and if the Lord take delight to do him good, and to do him good by my mouth; he will convey his Spirit of grace in ſome ſuch word as I have ſpoken unto him; but if the Lord do not breath by his Spirit in my words, then I would adviſe him to go and talk with ſome other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I would not limit him to any one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but let others alſo tell him, what Chriſt hath done for their ſouls; it may be the Lord may thereby convey himſelf: and I have ſometimes known this in experience, that when ſome have ſpoken ſcornfully of the free grace of God, yet when the ſame hath been held forth, their ſpirits have been ſubdued to ſtoop unto it; ſo great is the power of the word of Gods free grace, ſet home by the Spirit of God; and the meditation thereof doth ſerve greatly to the firm rooting of the peace of Gods people.</p>

It is a ground of much Conſolation to ſuch a ſoul who hath the Holy Ghoſt dwelling in him, he cannot reſt till he find the free grace of Jeſus Chriſt revealed to him by his holy Spirit, in ſome promiſe thereof; for Chriſt himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>That the Spirit of truth will take of mine, and ſhew it unto you, Joh.</hi> 16.14.

               <p>We now proceed unto the ninth Queſtion, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>9</label> which is, How doth God the <hi>Son</hi> give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant and union that ſhall never be diſſolved?</p>
               <p>In three acts or works about <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, in giving Chriſt, God doth give himſelf; and therefore here is the <hi>Son's</hi> work, to come, and <hi>take our nature upon him:</hi> For the <hi>Father</hi> gave him for that end, and the <hi>Son</hi> came to fulfil the will of the Father; and that is the Son's work, even the true diſtinct work of Chriſt. It properly belongeth unto the <hi>Son,</hi> to be our actual Redeemer from all ſin and miſery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Father draws us to the Son, and reveals the Son unto the ſoul; ſo doth the <hi>Son</hi> reveal the <hi>Father</hi> alſo: <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the Father doth accept us in his Son, as juſtified by his righteouſneſs, ſo the <hi>Son</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:170568:89"/>doth preſerve us in this eſtate, even to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom. Theſe therefore are the three works of the <hi>Son</hi> in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>He <hi>takes our nature</hi> upon him for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>He <hi>reveals</hi> the Father to us.</p>
               <p>He <hi>preſerveth</hi> us <hi>in</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>in himſelf.</hi> Let us ſpeak ſomething to each of theſe in particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe, That he <hi>took our nature</hi> upon him; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. &amp;c. <hi>For as much as the children are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him who had the power of death, that is the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore it was truly ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given,</hi> &amp;c. He took our nature upon him, lived a miſerable life, died a curſed death; this is the proper character, and work of the <hi>Son;</hi> and thus he is made an horn of ſalvation to us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.69. and all this floweth from the everlaſting <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> as alſo <hi>Zachariah</hi> Propheſied, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.72, 73. <hi>To perform the mercy promiſed to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant, the oath which he ſware to our father Abraham: By him we have redemption through his blood,</hi> Eph. 1.7. Col. 1.14. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Tit.</hi> 2.14. This then is the firſt work of the Son, to <hi>Redeem</hi> us: And the very phraſe of <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> doth imply a double ſtate of thoſe that are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170568:90"/>redeemed, without which it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to wit, The ſtate
<list>
                     <item>whence</item>
                     <item>and</item>
                     <item>whereunto</item>
                  </list> they are redeemed,</p>
               <p>Even <hi>from</hi> a ſtate of <hi>bondage, unto</hi> Chriſtian <hi>liberty;</hi> this is found in all redemption proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called: It findeth us in <hi>bondage,</hi> and ſetteth us in a ſtate of <hi>liberty,</hi> Heb. 2.14, 15. <hi>He took our nature upon him, that he might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, who through fear of death were all their life time made ſubject to bondage.</hi> And this third thing alſo is implyed (in the word Redemption) with both the former, namely, a certain <hi>price</hi> by which we are redeemed from bondage unto liberty. In a ſtate of Bondage we were under the <hi>Law</hi> and curſe of God, but <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law:</hi> Gal. 3.13. and now <hi>ſin ſhall no more have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us, for we are not under the law,</hi> Rom. 6.14. that is, not under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the Law, though we lie under the <hi>Commandment</hi> of it in Chriſt: we were ſometime under the bondage of ſin, under the guilt and ſtrength of ſin; but by Chriſt we have redemption, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the forgiveneſs of our ſin: and as the <hi>Law</hi> was the ſtrength of ſin; ſo <hi>ſin</hi> was the ſtrength and ſting of <hi>death,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. but now, <hi>O death where is thy ſting! O grave, where is thy victory! the Lord hath delivered us from him that hath the power of death,</hi> Col. 2.15. Heb. 2.14. and <hi>from this evil world:</hi> Gal. 1.4. and from <hi>the wrath come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.10.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170568:90"/>ſo then this was bondage we ſometimes lay under, when the Law of God preſſed heavily upon us the conſcience of ſin even unto death; both firſt, and ſecond death; and both <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>death</hi> delivered us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the power of <hi>Satan,</hi> and held us under the wrath of God; the world turned to be our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy in all the bleſſings and croſſes of it: from all theſe bondages Chriſt hath redeemed us; and it is a marvelous work in the eyes of all that enjoy the ben fit of it.</p>
               <p>If you ſhall ask, what Ranſom the Lord did pay, that we might be redeemed?</p>
               <p>The anſwer is given, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. <hi>There is one mediator between God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that he himſelf is the Ranſom. I will not ſtand diſputing whether he gave his <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> or <hi>paſſive obedience,</hi> or both; The Text is large, <hi>He gave himſelf,</hi> from the height of glory to become a mortal man, not ſinful, but by imputation; ſo that from firſt to laſt he <hi>gave himſelf.</hi> Conſider him therefore from his firſt taking our nature upon him, and all is but one ranſom; for his very <hi>active</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was <hi>paſſive,</hi> and his <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience was <hi>active;</hi> if he had not been active in his ſufferings, his ſufferings had not been ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, therefore he willingly laid down his life; <hi>No man taketh it from him, but he layeth it down of himſelf, Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. elſe had not his death been of any ſweet ſmelling ſavour to the Lord: forced death is no acceptable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p>Again, on the other ſide; his <hi>active</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170568:91"/>was <hi>paſſive;</hi> he ſuffered himſelf to be cloſed in his Mothers womb, and when he was born he ſuffered himſelf to be laid in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and although being God over all, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever, he was ſubject to no Law, yet now he ſuffered himſelf to be obedient unto his Father: now for great Princes to live in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dominions, to obſerve their Rules, and be guided by their Laws, it is a ſuffering. This did the Lord Jeſus; for he had a ſpecial commandment to obſerve both <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;</hi> and in this the Divine Nature doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as much, as for the Creator to become a creature, and to take upon him the terms of hardſhip which become a creature: It is no debaſement unto Angels, nor unto Saints, to be obedient; but for the Creator to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto the Law of God given unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in this he greatly humbleth himſelf; when he ſaith, <hi>Thus it behooveth us to fulfil all righteouſneſs, Mat.</hi> 3.15. And this is ſuch kind of paſſion as hath all things tending to ſatisfaction in it. And by all this you may ſee, that from the firſt to the laſt the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is a <hi>Ranſom;</hi> take him in his Cradle, and he is a Ranſom; take him throughout all the courſe of his life, and he is <hi>paſſive,</hi> and in all his ſufferings he is <hi>active:</hi> He went up and down doing good, and ſuffering evil all his life long; and thus he is a Ranſom: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, when as he came to wreſtle with the wrath of his Father, he did therein exceed all the reſt of his ſufferings: It was much indeed for the Son of God to make himſelf a <hi>ſervant;</hi> but when he that is the Son of the eternal
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170568:91"/>God, and in regard of his God-head equal with the Father, ſhall now ſtand to wreſtle with the unſupportable wrath of God, and to cry out, My ſoul is in an agony unto the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry death, and through anguiſh thereof to ſweat drops of bloud; and though his heart as it were ſeems to recoil, ſo that <hi>if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he deſires the cup might paſs from him,</hi> yet he is carried before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and is there condemned, and afterward ſuffereth the death of the <hi>Croſs:</hi> this was the chiefeſt part of the ranſom, which the Lord did intend to pay to the juſtice of his Father; wherein he did alſo undergo the very pangs of <hi>Hell</hi> for our ſins, and ſo gave himſelf a Ranſom for us. And had not all this been, we ſhould never have been redeemed from the terrours of the Law. Thus therefore did the Lord <hi>give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> in <hi>taking</hi> our nature upon him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf unto a ſtate of <hi>bondage,</hi> from a ſtate of liberty, to redeem us unto liberty from a ſtate of bondage under the curſe of the <hi>Law</hi> of God, even unto liberty from <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> and this <hi>World,</hi> and from the <hi>indignation</hi> of the moſt High: A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deliverance!</p>
               <p>But as it is in all other liberties; ſo this <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> doth ſtand in two things: Firſt, As in <hi>removing</hi> ſome <hi>bondage,</hi> and <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens:</hi> Secondly, So it carrieth with it ſome ſuch <hi>priviledge</hi> and <hi>enfranchiſement</hi> as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by me claim ſome liberties which others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach unto; and thoſe the Lord Jeſus hath dearly paid for, by ſuffering his Fathers wrath, which did ſo drink up his Spirits, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170568:92"/>I believe he died not by the pains of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for he died before his time; but the wrath of God did ſwallow him up principally, though his bodily pains did help it forward. Now by this means we have <hi>acceſs unto the Lord, and into this grace wherein we ſtand,</hi> Rom. 5.2. and that with <hi>boldneſs,</hi> and <hi>confidence, Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. even <hi>to enter with boldneſs into the holieſt by the bloud of Jeſus, Hob.</hi> 10.19. Hereby we have <hi>liberty</hi> to call God <hi>Father,</hi> and to come unto him as to a <hi>Father,</hi> and to expect all <hi>bleſſings</hi> from him for this life, and for a better, both <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and <hi>redemption</hi> from all miſeries and dangers, even from death to life, even life eternal; beſides all bleſſings of the Kingdom of grace here below: All <hi>Church-priviledges,</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth-priviledges,</hi> hath the Lord purchaſed for us by his bloud: great and large are the liberties which the Lord hath purchaſed for us, that are recorded every where in Scripture. So that <hi>if the Son ſhall make you free, then are you free indeed</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the <hi>ſecond work</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> in this everlaſting Covenant. Preſuppoſing the Lord God the Father to have drawn the ſoul unto the Son from all <hi>confidence</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> and in his own <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and in his own <hi>returnings</hi> unto God by believing through his <hi>own power,</hi> from <hi>confidence</hi> in his own <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,</hi> and his own <hi>waiting upon Chriſt;</hi> and from all <hi>confidence</hi> in <hi>priviledges,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of nature, and grace received; now it may be all this while the poor ſoul knoweth not who it is, that hath wrought all this work in him,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170568:92"/>and for him; and it may be he is ſo far to ſeek in this, as that he knows not whether it be the Lord God the Father, or the work of ſome enemy to deceive him: though he all this while ſeeth his need of Chriſt, and hath none in heaven but him, none in earth in compariſon of him, of the want of whom he is ſenſible; yet the ſoul knows not whether all this humiliation, which is wrought in him, come from the wrath or mercy of God, and whether God hath not in all this, given him only a taſte of the very torments of Hell, and the pledge of them, to his everlaſting perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thus may the poor ſoul be affraid notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this gracious work wrought in him, above all the power of the creature: though the Lord hath not ſaid much of it unto him, yet he hath done it; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py we that ever the Lord hath owned us ſo far.</p>
               <p>Now here is the ſpecial work of the <hi>Son,</hi> he doth <hi>bring us</hi> back again to the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals</hi> what the Father hath done unto us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his rich grace that hath taken all this pains with us; for <hi>as no man knows the Son, but the Father: ſo neither doth any man know the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Son, and be to whom the Son will reveal him, Mat.</hi> 11.27. So that the Lord Jeſus doth <hi>enlighten</hi> the ſoul, by the anointing of his bleſſed Spirit, to ſee what it is that the Lord hath done for him in mercy; which heretofore he thought was done in wrath: whence the ſoul begins to ſee the <hi>Fathers love,</hi> even the goodneſs of a God in what hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon him, far beyond what he could have
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170568:93"/>asked, or thought for; And therefore now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with ſome more hope, and liberty to call God <hi>Father:</hi> for from this work of the <hi>Son,</hi> there doth ariſe the two characters of a Son in the ſoul, both which are comprized in this one, that is <hi>liberty:</hi> and there is a double li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty wherein a ſon doth ſtand: 1. Firſt, He hath <hi>eaſe</hi> from all his doubtful <hi>fears,</hi> or at leaſt from a great part of the burden of them; ſome refocilations, ſome kind of quietneſs fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon the heart of a wearyed ſinner, whence the heart is eaſed beyond his thoughts; although as yet his comfort ſtands rather in expectation, then in actual fruition; as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Come unto me all you that are weary, and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt, Mat.</hi> 11.28.29. He doth not promiſe <hi>ſudden reſt:</hi> He will give you <hi>preſent eaſe;</hi> but learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, and you <hi>ſhall</hi> find <hi>reſt</hi> unto your ſouls. The Lord will give reſt unto the ſouls of his people; at the preſent he gives them eaſe, and an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of much more plentiful fruition of reſt and peace, which they have begun to taſte of.</p>
               <p>And how doth the Lord eaſe the ſoul in ſuch a caſe, ſo as that they feel the burden a great deal lighter? How doth the <hi>Son</hi> quiet, and ſtill, and refreſh the ſoul? Is it by the ſight of his own hungering and thirſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter righteouſneſs?</p>
               <p>What ſaith the Lord in ſuch a caſe? Or how doth he ſatisfie the ſoul? He telleth us plainly where our ſatisfaction is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37, 38, 39. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170568:93"/>and drink:</hi> So that if a man thirſt, how ſhall he ſatisfie himſelf in his thirſting? This is the main queſtion in many a ſoul; May I not draw conſolation out of this, that I do thirſt after the Lord Jeſus?</p>
               <p>You ſhall find, that the Lord doth not bid me go ſatisfie my ſelf by ſeeing my thirſt: If a man ſhall ſay, I am exceeding thirſty, and I ſhall tell him that he is a man of a healthful conſtitution, becauſe a man in a Frenzy is thirſty, and knows it not; this will not ſatisfie his thirſt.</p>
               <p>How therefore comes the ſoul to be freed of his burdens? He thirſteth after Chriſt, and none of all the creatures can quench his thirſt; therefore our Saviour proclaims this in the laſt and great day of the Feaſt, when moſt of the Jewes were preſent (for this Feaſt laſted eight days) <hi>If any man be now athirſt,</hi> and not ſatisfied with all the Ordinances they had now enjoyed: he doth not ſend them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, nor doth he bid them ſatisfie themſelves with their own thirſtings; neither doth he tell them, that their bleſſedneſs lyeth in that they do thirſt (though there be a bleſſedneſs in it) but how then ſhall they be ſatisfied? <hi>Let him come to me, and drink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this is the <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> which the Lord brings us unto, when he works in us unquenchable deſires after Chriſt: if you would comfort a ſoul, and tell him you do thirſt after Chriſt; &amp; that you could not have done if Chriſt had not wrought it in your ſoul; you ſay true, and there may be more in ſuch a ſoul then he is aware of; yet Chriſt is not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170568:94"/>wont to leave the ſoul to quench his thirſt with his thirſt: but you will ſay, Is not hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering and thirſting a ſign of health? For a ſurfetted body doth not hunger: true: yet the Lord doth not direct the ſoul to content himſelf with his own act; but, <hi>Come unto me.</hi> But will the Lord Jeſus give him drink? He promiſeth that he will; <hi>Let him come to me, and drink:</hi> And he ſaith moreover, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of water of life: this he ſpake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive; for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified:</hi> ſo as that which now the <hi>Son</hi> doth, is not the proper characteriſtical work of the Spirit; but Jeſus Chriſt doth come unto the ſoul, and comforts it in ſome meaſure; and, which is a ſecond degree of liberty, giveth ſome liberty of <hi>hope,</hi> that the Lord will at the length be pleaſed to fill him with his bleſſed Spirit, which the Lord did more abundantly pour out upon the Diſciples after his Reſurrection: And there is yet a more abundant fulfilling of all, when he doth come unto the proper work of the Spirit; and therefore he diſtinguiſheth his own work, from the work of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17, 18. and 16.7, 13. he ſaith of himſelf, that <hi>He will not leave them comfortleſs;</hi> but he putteth this difference between his own work, and the work of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Hitherto I have ſpoken unto you in parables; but the time comes, when I ſhall ſhew you plainly of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> yet he had ſpoken much unto them, and told them that <hi>he loved them,</hi> and that <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170568:94"/>loved them;</hi> but all is but a kind of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in compariſon of what the Lord will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reveal, when he doth more fully ſend forth his Spirit into their hearts. In the mean while himſelf ſetteth on ſome word or other of his grace, whereby he gives the ſoul ſuch a taſte of himſelf (more then reprobates can have) as makes him thirſt after more and more of Chriſt, until he be ſatisfied with the riches of the grace of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, When the <hi>Son</hi> hath thus brought us unto the Father, and ſhewed us his fatherly love toward us, as he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.26, 27. <hi>I ſay not, that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himſelf loveth you.</hi> Then doth he <hi>keep</hi> us in this eſtate: And (which is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work of the Son) for this purpoſe, he will <hi>ſend</hi> us his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> as He told his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7. <hi>It is expedient for you, that I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you</hi> Thus as the <hi>Father ſent</hi> the <hi>Son:</hi> ſo will the <hi>Son</hi> ſend the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and in the mean while he doth <hi>preſerve</hi> us until the Spirit come; and then he preſerveth us by his <hi>Spirit.</hi> Now ſometimes he makes his people tarry lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, before he ſend the Spirit in this kind of diſpenſation (but we leave the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof, unto the free purpoſe of the grace of God) but I ſay, mean while the <hi>Son</hi> preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the Fathers will, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> So Joh. 17.12. <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi> He keeps us in a waiting frame of ſpirit, ſo that we cannot but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170568:95"/>thirſt after him, and long for him, and mourn for the want of him; and then <hi>a bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, until he bring forth judgement unto victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Mat. 12.20. Thus hath the Lord Jeſus promiſed to keep us, and this he doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Partly, by praying for us, Luk. 22.31, 32. Simon, Simon, <hi>Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat; but I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee that thy ſaith fail not:</hi> ſo Joh. 17.11, 20, 21, 22, 23, &amp;c. <hi>Holy Father, keep through thy own Name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be one, as we are,</hi> &amp;c. and this is the eternal efficacy of the <hi>Son,</hi> whereby every beleeving ſoul is kept until he do finde fulneſs of accompliſhment of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual deſires: and though we may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies wanting in prayer for our ſelves, yet he will give us his Spirit to pray within us with ſighs and groans that cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as he 'will keep us by his prayer: ſo ſecondly, by his <hi>ruling Providence;</hi> for <hi>all power is given unto him, both in heaven, and in earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. and this power he doth employ to preſerve his ſervants from all the deluſions of the ſons of men. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> complains of ſome, that thruſt away, and ſhoulder out the people of God, Ezek. 34.21, 22, &amp;c. but, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will ſet up one ſhepherd over them, and he ſhall feed them, even my ſervant</hi> David: verſ. 23, &amp; 25. <hi>They ſhall dwell ſafely in the wilderneſs, and ſleep in the woods.</hi> None of all the deluſions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170568:95"/>none of all the power of Tyrants, not all the flattering world, nor all the perſecuting world ſhall be able to ſhoulder off the Saints of God from him, 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him againſt that day:</hi> and the Lord Jeſus engageth both his own power, and his Fathers power for this end, Joh. 10.28, 29. <hi>I give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall they pluck them out of my hand: my Father, which gave them me, is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand.</hi> Thus have you ſeen how <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> gives himſelf unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, to become one with us, to lead a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, and dye an accurſed death, thereby to redeem us from all our enemies unto a ſtate of <hi>liberty,</hi> by an invaluable price, even by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And having thus had the <hi>Father</hi> drawing us unto Chriſt, (though the Father ſaid little unto the ſoul who had been about him all this while, and ſo leaves the ſoul in no ſmall diſtreſs) as the <hi>Fathers</hi> work is <hi>Power,</hi> ſo the <hi>Sons</hi> work is <hi>Liberty;</hi> and he revealeth to us our redemption; and reveals it ſo, that the ſoul is ſet in an earneſt longing after Chriſt, (in whom there is a way to the Father) and a great mourning after him, hungring for him; ſo that nothing in heaven nor earth can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him: in which caſe, the Lord doth give ſuch ſtrength and conſtancy unto the ſoul, in looking towards Chriſt, as encourageth him to expect refreſhing in the end; though at preſent he looks at all that he hath attained as a parable in compariſon of what he would
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170568:96"/>further enjoy in communion with Jeſus Chriſt: but it often befals the ſervants of God, as it did the Diſciples of Chriſt; they were put unto new demurrs, and doubtings: <hi>We thought</hi> (ſay they) <hi>it had been he that ſhould have reſtored the kingdome to Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 24.21. (theſe were <hi>Simon,</hi> and <hi>Cleophas</hi>) if it had not been He, where was the comfort and bleſſed hope of reſt, which they looked for in Jeſus Chriſt? we thought it had been <hi>he;</hi> a ſign it was a demurr, and diſpute in them, whether it was Gods grace in them, or Chriſt that had been with them, yea, or no: whileſt they are at this debate in themſelves, <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf comes unto them, and reproves them for their unbelief, and chargeth them to tarry at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and there <hi>to wait for the promiſe of the Father.</hi> And thus doth the Lord Jeſus teach us to <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and reveals him to us by ſtrengthning us unto all ſuch holy duties as he calleth us unto: and though we be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times affraid to pray, to hear, to come to Chriſtian conference; yet the Lord will not ſuffer us to refrain, but we muſt pray, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and hear; and when we have uſed all, he teacheth us to know, that it is not in all theſe, as of themſelves, to work any thing in us; nor doth he ſuffer us to content our ſelves in any thing wrought in us, but cauſeth us to thirſt after more of himſelf in every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, until the <hi>Spirit</hi> comes in a plentiful meaſure, according to all the latitude of our deſires after Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

Take you an hypocrite, and if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to mourn for Chriſt, and the like, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth himſelf in theſe things; but is this the way of the working of Gods almighty power, to bring men unto ſomething that is in themſelves?

So
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170568:97"/>that this is the way that God calleth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to walk in, namely, to <hi>look</hi> unto Chriſt, to <hi>turn unto this ſtrong hold,</hi> Zach. 9.12. <hi>By his bloud he hath delivered his priſoners out of the pit, wherein there it no water:</hi> our ſtrength lieth not in our own hungring and thirſting, and poverty, though there be truth in theſe; and everlaſting truth, by reaſon of the Spirit that wrought them, and the bloud that bought them; yet your ſtrong hold is not in them, but in the rock of Iſrael; he is the horn of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to his people: ſo that I would adviſe every poor ſoul, in whom is wrought any mourning after Chriſt, through ſence of your need of him, make the Lord Jeſus your ſtrong hold. And this is the true work, and way of the <hi>Son</hi> of God to bring you to the Father; and the more you find the Lord Jeſus, the more you ſhall diſcern the gifts that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto you, and the comfort and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them: not that I deny that Jeſus Chriſt doth open unto the ſoul, what he hath done for him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.69. <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God;</hi> ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.30. but he doth not ſhew them for this end, that you ſhould ſatisfie your ſelves in them, but ſtill come unto him: what though you have many gracious promiſes that promiſe many future conſolations? it is, that you ſhould ſeek unto the Lord, in whom they are laid up; and unto the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, that promiſed them, in whoſe hand it is to make them all good unto us: thus in all this doth the Lord train up his ſervants unto an heavenly and Chriſtian frame; and if the

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> another end of this <hi>inhabitation</hi> of the Spirit, is to keep <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> for the Lord in our hearts againſt all adverſary power; for if the Lord ſhould leave his gifts only to keep poſſeſſion there, the devil would make very hard work with the beſt gifts that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: he blaſted all the precious gifts that <hi>Adam</hi> had received, which were more perfect in degrees than any we receive; and yet when all the powers of darkneſs and gates of hell are banded together againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his ſervants, there is not the leaſt of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God that falleth away finally: and the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> gives the reaſon of it, 1 Joh. 4.4. <hi>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them, becauſe greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world.</hi> Neither are we <hi>preſerved</hi> by faith only, but <hi>by the mighty power of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. The <hi>Spirit</hi> it is that ſetteth <hi>Faith</hi> awork, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> it is that ſetteth the <hi>Spirit</hi> awork, to keep us unto his heavenly kingdom. And from this poſſeſſion of the Spirit, there comes a gariſon, as it were, to be kept in our hearts, whereby our ſouls are kept alive; ſo that the Spirit doth not only ſhed abroad his gifts into our hearts, but he keeps our hearts in a ſweet frame of ſanctification, 2 Tim. 1.14. <hi>That good thing which was committed to thee, keep by the Holy Ghoſt, which dwelleth in us;</hi> that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170568:100"/>goodly <hi>depoſitum,</hi> his <hi>Evangeliſtical Gift</hi> that did accompany his own ſalvation, and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Church, he muſt keep it by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt that dwelleth in us;</hi> otherwiſe our gifts would ſoon vapour out into ſmoak and aſhes, whether it be faith, hope, zeal, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, courage, or whatſoever elſe is requiſite for the ſalvation of Gods people: the Spirit by his power dwelling in us, acteth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth them: <hi>the ſons of God are led by the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.14. nor is this a confining of the Spirit of God unto poor houſes of clay: <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Temple could not contain him; no, not the heaven of heavens; he dwelleth above all heavens unmeaſurably, yet <hi>he dwelleth alſo with him that is of an humble and contrite ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. though it were a poor kitchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy that hath ſuch a ſpirit, he dwelleth there, <hi>to revive the ſpirit of the humble.</hi> As thoſe that dwell in earthly houſes, there they take up their reſt, and lay up their treaſure; and there they delight to converſe: even thus doth the Spirit of God; and it is a wonderful Indulgence of the moſt High, that <hi>dwels in temples made without hands,</hi> ſo to be pleaſed to dwell in the ſons and daughters of men, to make good his own eternal counſel for their ſalvation. There is I confeſs alſo ſome kinde of preſence of the Spirit of God even in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that are only fitted to ſome work of God, and therefore only attain to ſome work of common Grace, but not ſuch as doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſalvation: you will finde this difference between them, and Gods own children; the Spirit of God indeed comes upon them, as he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170568:101"/>did upon <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.10. ſo that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied; and more then ſo, he doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continue with them for a ſeaſon, and ſo journeth a while in them, according as ſometimes it is ſaid, Jer. 14.8. he is <hi>like a ſtranger, or a wayfaring man, that tarrieth for a night;</hi> thus we read, 1 Sam. 16.14, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord departed from</hi> Saul, <hi>and an evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from the Lord troubled him;</hi> a ſign the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God had been with him before. So <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah,</hi> when he ſmote <hi>Micaiah</hi> on the cheek, and ſaid, <hi>Which way went the Spirit of God from me, to ſpeak unto thee?</hi> 1 King. 22.24. a ſign it may be that he had ſometimes found the Spirit of God, but now he was departed: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, the Spirit of God is in them but for a ſeaſon, until he be grieved by them, and then he doth depart; and indeed did never beſtow any regenerating grace upon them, but only fitted them for ſome kinde of ſervice for his Church, or the Common-wealth. So likewiſe <hi>Jehu,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> did much for a ſeaſon, by the Spirit of God; he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten their minds, and open their mouthes, and gave free paſſage to their adminiſtrations; and you may ſometimes wonder how men have been aſſiſted in the pulpit both in prayer and preaching, that have been notorious in wickedneſs: thus it pleaſeth God to come, and ſojourn in them, and work great works by them, ſuch as may be of great uſe among his people, and may leave themſelves without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: but you ſee where the difference lieth, even as it lay between the anointing of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Jehu; David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> the anointing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170568:101"/>of <hi>Saul,</hi> was with a Vial of Oyl, and of <hi>Jehu</hi> with a Box of Oyl, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.1. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.1. the word in the Original is the ſame in both places, and it was not an empty Ceremony; Gods Ceremonies are accompanied with gifts ſutable unto them: his Spirit came upon them both, and they did mighty ſervice in their times; but when <hi>David</hi> was to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, God commanded <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>fill his horn with oyl,</hi> in 1 Sam. 16.1. and in like manner did <hi>Zadok</hi> unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.39. Now an <hi>horn</hi> is not of a brittle Metal, but a <hi>glaſs</hi> is ſoon broken; the <hi>horn</hi> is the beauty and power of the Beaſt: ſo that when the Spirit is conveyed in the <hi>horn</hi> and power of Jeſus, Chriſt, it now giveth beauty and ſtrength unto the ſoul, and is not dryed up, nor broken in pieces, but abideth in the Saints unto the heavenly Kingdom. This is the firſt work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God; he doth give himſelf unto his people in a way of <hi>Inhabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> he dwelleth in them, and unites them to Chriſt, and keeps them from being drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God, by men or Angels, (I mean evil Angels) and preſerves alive all their gifts and graces; and acts and quickens them, ſo as may be for the edification of thoſe that are with them in Church and Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, as the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God gives himſelf in a work of <hi>Inhabitation:</hi> ſo doth he give himſelf in a work of <hi>ſanctification:</hi> and that is a work uſual in all our Catechiſms, <hi>[the Holy Ghoſt doth ſanctifie and preſerve us.]</hi> Let us look into ſome places of Scripture for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170568:102"/>the proof of it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you, through ſanctification of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. he choſe us to be ſaved through a courſe of ſanctification: it is not the cauſe of <hi>election,</hi> but the way of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> in which the Spirit leadeth us: ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God, through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience.</hi> So that it is the Spirit that <hi>ſanctifieth</hi> us to be obedient: and a notable place to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe have we in the delivery of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their heart;</hi> he means, the law of <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> and he will ſo write it in the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that it ſhall be carried an end with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in them: accordingly doth the Apoſtle teſtifie concerning the Corinthians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Ye are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtred by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of the heart:</hi> it is the Spirit of God therefore that writeth theſe laws in our hearts, and leaveth an impreſſion of ſome meaſure of power to be guided by them; <hi>He worketh in us both to will, and to do, of his own good pleaſure;</hi> he ſtampeth upon the ſoul ſuch gifts of his grace, as make us ſerviceable in our courſe to his heavenly Kingdom: and hence it is, that we read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit with in you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes,</hi> &amp;c. this is a ſpirit of ſanctification. To make it ſomewhat more plain; The Spirit of God is ſaid to be our <hi>ſanctifier,</hi> partly as he doth work the work
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170568:102"/>of the two other perſons, and partly as he worketh his own work; though in all theſe works they all concur, yet they have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral characters, wherein they more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly ſhine forth: whatever work any of the perſons do, they do it by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and yet he doth a peculiar work, wherein though they concur, yet he is eminent in it. It is the proper work of the <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>draw</hi> us unto Chriſt: Joh. 6.44. &amp; 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abundant mercy hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us again unto a lively hope;</hi> that is the proper work of a <hi>Father,</hi> to <hi>beget;</hi> he <hi>ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth abroad the Spirit upon us through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3.6. thus doth the <hi>Holy Ghoſt ſanctifie</hi> us, as the <hi>Father</hi> doth <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> us, and frame us to be new creatures; though it be the Father's work in us, yet he worketh it by the Holy Spirit. And for the work of the <hi>Son,</hi> the proper character of a ſon is <hi>liberty,</hi> a ſervant is in bondage; a child in the way of child-like liberty may expect much from his Father: this the Lord Jeſus properly giveth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me, and I will give you reſt;</hi> freedom, and eaſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he gives his ſervants: and how doth he work this eaſe and liberty, but by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? the ſame Spirit that is in him, dwelleth in us, and breaths a kind of liberty in us, which it hath from Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>For where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17. and where he is, you may ſee the ſoul hath liberty from the anguiſh of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo that, is there any eaſe? any liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170568:103"/>It is from Jeſus Chriſt the Son of <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> who hath ſpoken ſome peace unto the ſoul. Thus the <hi>Father</hi> doth <hi>reveal</hi> the Son in us; and in point of <hi>ſanctification</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> doth <hi>regenerate</hi> us, but it is by a ſpirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the <hi>Son redeemeth</hi> us into liberty by a ſpirit of liberty; he comes in the Fathers name, and in the Sons name, to carry on that work, which they have in hand in the Saints, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. and <hi>chap.</hi> 15.26. <hi>the Father will ſend him,</hi> and <hi>I will ſend him;</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth kindly work all, to make us rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſons unto the Lord: theſe things he doth in their name; he doth ſome things alſo in his own name, though from their power alſo: now though both theſe are ſanctifying works, there is a third work of <hi>ſanctification</hi> which is proper to the Spirit; this was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.8. <hi>You ſhall receive power after the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you:</hi> they were the ſons of God before, and free ſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſet at liberty by the Spirit of the Son; but there is yet more to come; <hi>You ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power after the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you:</hi> ſo this is the proper ſanctifying work of the Spirit, to give a <hi>further power</hi> in ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; he doth imprint a character of <hi>power</hi> upon our ſanctification, that we have not only <hi>power</hi> to be called the ſons of God, nor to be free ſons of God, but powerful alſo, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. the <hi>Lord hath given us the Spirit of power:</hi> when the Spirit worketh this, he worketh his own proper work. And as there is ſuch a kind of threefold degree in a ſpirit of <hi>ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> ſo there is a kind of ſemblable work, that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170568:103"/>is found in hypocrites in ſome meaſure; for as you read of the Holy Ghoſt his coming upon them, ſo ſhall you find mention made of their <hi>ſanctification,</hi> Heb. 10.29. they are ſaid <hi>to tread under foot the bloud of the Covenant, wherewith they were ſanctified:</hi> ſo Mat. 20.16. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> doth he mean, by the outward call of the word? truly you ſhall find, that the context will carry you much farther then ſo; for conſider upon what occaſion our Saviour ſpeaketh it: there was a certain rich man, that would have forſaken all, and followed Chriſt, but he found it too coſtly; but <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>We have forſaken all, and followed thee, what ſhall we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? verily,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ye that have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in the regeneration,</hi> (meaning, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of the world) <hi>ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones,</hi> &amp;c. but many of thoſe that do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake much, <hi>ſhall be laſt; and the laſt ſhall be firſt: for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain houſholder, that hired men into his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; and ſome he hired early in the morning, ſome at the third hour, ſome at the ſixth, ſome at the ninth, ſome at the eleventh; and when he comes to reckon, he payeth every man a peny: they that bore the heat of the day, expected to have received more;</hi> whereupon the Lord Jeſus gives this as one anſwer, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> they may be called to forſake brethren, and ſiſters, and fathers, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that out of conſcience unto Chriſt; and much they have done for Chriſt; they have laboured for Chriſt, and born the burden and heat of the day; they had a calling to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170568:104"/>come into the vineyard, and there they have wrought; and yet of theſe; few are choſen: ſo that it was not a meer verbal calling, no, here is a kind of ſtrong ſpiritual calling; which did prevail to withdraw them, from all the comforts of this life, ſo far it was effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and yet theſe were not choſen: ſo that there is a <hi>ſanctification,</hi> that doth not flow from Gods eternal election; and therefore it is not to be deſpiſed, that the Apoſtle doth add, Rom. 8.28. <hi>To them that are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpoſe;</hi> otherwiſe there is a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that comes from Gods <hi>purpoſe of free grace;</hi> and then it carrieth them along no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to do ſome outward ſervice for God; they may do much harveſt-work, and yet not be called according to purpoſe: ſo then we ſee there is a calling and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that reacheth unto them that are but common hypocrites; whence it comes to paſs, they will work much according to it, for <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> is that which worketh <hi>from God,</hi> the <hi>things of God,</hi> and <hi>for the glory of God;</hi> this is ſanctification in the proper meaning of it; and this you ſhall find in hypocrites: For they will work <hi>from</hi> God, Mat. 7.22. <hi>Have not we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils?</hi> they knew their own name would not reach it, therefore they will make God their efficient cauſe: and it is a great word, which the Lord ſpake unto <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 King. 10.30. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt done well in executing that which was right in my eyes, and haſt done unto the houſe of Ahab according to all that was in my heart;</hi> thus he wrought the things of God,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170568:104"/>and pretended the glory of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. and which is more wonderful, that they ſhould for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt do many things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. and theſe not choſen, and ſuch as ſhall be laſt in the recompence; and what is yet wanting in theſe mens ſanctification? is the change of their heart wanting? truly, not altogether; for the Lord gave <hi>Saul</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9. But mind it, though it was ſomewhat altered in <hi>quality,</hi> yet not in <hi>ſubstance;</hi> it was not a new heart, not an heart of fleſh, for that is peculiar to the Covenant of Grace; they want that ſelf-denying faith that is found in all new-hearted Chriſtians, whereby they deny even themſelves, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. for a man to be all <hi>from</hi> Chriſt, and all <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, and all <hi>for</hi> Chriſt; this is wanting to theſe <hi>moral ſanctifications</hi> that are found in men. But wherein then is the defect of their ſanctification diſcovered? in this: Take you a man ſanctified, as <hi>Saul, Jehu, Judas, Demas,</hi> theſe were men of good account; <hi>Samuel</hi> had a good eſteem of <hi>Saul;</hi> and <hi>Jonadab</hi> bears <hi>Jehu</hi> record, that his heart was upright with him; the <hi>Diſciples</hi> miſtruſt themſelves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Judas;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ranketh <hi>Demas,</hi> with <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> his fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers; yet in all theſe here was no ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying faith: for he that comes to Chriſt, and cloſeth with Chriſt, muſt <hi>deny himſelf;</hi> ſo then in this theſe men do ſhew themſelves dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the choſen of God, they come not to Chriſt with a ſelf-denying heart; they ſeem to work all in the name of Chriſt, yet they ſtill work in their own power and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170568:105"/>ſtrength, or at leaſt they work <hi>for themſelves.</hi> You read of ſome, that took delight in the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.2, 3. and yet if God do not hear their prayers, they are offended; a ſign they wrought in the ſence of the worth of their own works: ſo alſo thoſe in Mat. 7.22. <hi>Have not we propheſied in thy name?</hi> they do expoſtulate with God, why he ſhould caſt off them; they expected a bountiful reward for the works they had done: they wrought <hi>from</hi> themſelves, and <hi>for</hi> themſelves: and ſo thoſe many that were called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20 they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied father, and mother, and wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and therefore they looked for great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, having borne the burden and heat of the day: and this is the proper character of an hypocrite, he doth challenge his reward out of the worth of his work; whereas the choſen ones of God are taught to ſay, <hi>When we have done all that is commanded us, we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> Luk. 17.10. this is one difference in the riſe of the work.</p>
               <p>Again, there is a difference in the work it ſelf: Gods choſen ones work the <hi>will of Chriſt,</hi> and not their own, though their will alſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth along with it: others work the will of Chriſt, as far as it will ſtand with their own: <hi>Jebu</hi>'s zeal did root out <hi>Baal,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Abab</hi> freely; he drove on furiouſly, for it was an act of his own ambitious heart, to ſettle his own Kingdom: this he aimed at, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he go; <hi>from the ſins of Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat he departed not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Laſtly, Hypocrites will out-ſhoot Chriſt in his own bow; they will aim at their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170568:105"/>
                  <hi>own ends</hi> in Chriſts works: <hi>Jehu</hi> will root out <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> but it is to eſtabliſh his own Kingdom; to walk in all the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments he did not regard: while Gods will accompliſheth his will, he goeth along with it, but no farther. Thus we ſee there is a work of ſanctification under a Covenant of works, ſuch as whereby men have another heart, and many gifts of courage, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and zeal, and power come upon them for the ſervice of the Church; and yet you will find that they will work <hi>from</hi> themſelves, and <hi>for</hi> themſelves; and for God they will not work beyond their own ends: and though they ſeem to walk with him for a while, yet you ſhall ſoon ſee the Lord will take one courſe, and they will take another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We now come unto a <hi>third work</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in which he doth give himſelf as God unto his people; for in all theſe works he doth work as God, and ſo expreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: this work is <hi>Divine revelation;</hi> he doth reveal himſelf like a God in the ſoul, that ſo you may acknowledge his preſence, power and truth: a very clear place we have for it, Eph. 1.17, 18. &amp;c. <hi>I ceaſe not to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, may give unto you the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him,</hi> &amp;c. mark how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth conſider God in regard of his moſt eminent glory, and power; as he is the God of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Father of glory, <hi>That he might give us the Spirit of wiſdom and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the knowledge of him;</hi> that is, of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170568:106"/>Father, Son and Spirit: <hi>That the eyes of your underſtanding being enlightened, ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the ſaints,</hi> &amp;c. minde what Divine revelation here is, ſee how gloriouſly <hi>God</hi> is ſet forth that <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi> it, and alſo the <hi>gift</hi> that is given: and theſe things the Apoſtle prayeth not only for glorious and tranſcendent Chriſtians, men of renown; but for all the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> for all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chriſtians among them; he would have none of them deſtitute of a Spirit of wiſdom and revelation: and what ſhould this Spirit do? it ſhould <hi>enlighten</hi> the organ, even the eyes of their underſtanding, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is beyond the power of created gifts, to reach the clear diſcerning of the myſteries of the Kingdom of God, as they are diſpenſed in the Goſpel of Chriſt: and as in all ſight there is the <hi>Organ,</hi> and the <hi>Medium,</hi> and the <hi>Object;</hi> the <hi>eye</hi> is the <hi>organ,</hi> the <hi>air</hi> is the <hi>medium,</hi> the <hi>thing ſeen</hi> is the <hi>object:</hi> ſo doth the Apoſtle here pray, that <hi>the eyes of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding might be enlightened,</hi> far above the capacity of Reaſon, yea, above the capacity of the ſpiritual gifts, which they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for he deſires that a ſpirit of <hi>wiſdom and revelation</hi> might be given them: though the Lord had bleſſed them with all ſpiritual bleſſings already; they had believed, and had been ſealed; yet here is ſomething more to be attained, they want a further enlightening by the clearing of the <hi>word</hi> of God, which is the <hi>medium,</hi> by which we diſcern all things therein: and for the <hi>Object,</hi> he doth expreſs

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170568:109"/>true, but he is not yet clear in it; it is that <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that muſt make him to hear the voice of joy and gladneſs: otherwiſe, though a man hath much experience of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, and ſits and talks of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things that God hath done for him, to the warming of the hearts of all that hear him; yet the ſoul cannot reach that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfaction, which he doth deſire, till at length the Lord comes in ſome Ordinance of his, and beareth witneſs freely of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us; and ſuch a teſtimony will marvelouſly ſettle and eſtabliſh any ſoul in the world: ſo that it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> that beareth witneſs unto faith, and nothing can do it but the <hi>Spirit</hi> only; and yet if the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhould breath out of the word, it were but a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Iſai. 8.20. <hi>To the law and to the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: if they ſpeak not according to that, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no light in them:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord couples his <hi>word,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> together, Iſai. 57.19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace:</hi> though it be <hi>creating</hi> work, yet it is by the fruit of the <hi>lips:</hi> ſo likewiſe Iſai. 59.21. <hi>My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, from henceforth and for ever.</hi> Thus the Spirit of God in the word is mighty to begin, and mighty to <hi>carry an end</hi> ſpiritual work in the ſoul.

Mat. 16.17. Was there no comfort in Chriſt his revealing the Father to them? doubtleſs there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in all theſe works: the work of the <hi>Father</hi> mentioned in Joh. 6.44. is the ſame with what we read, Iſai. 54.13. <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of God, and great ſhall be the peace of thy Children:</hi> though it be but <hi>peace</hi> for the <hi>future,</hi> yet <hi>light is ſowen for the righteous</hi> herein, and <hi>gladneſs for the upright in heart,</hi> Pſal. 97.11. there is ſome ground-work of light and comfort in the Fathers work, and ſome ſparkles of it do appear; for the Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals the Son; and the Son is no ſooner ſeen, but hope is ſeen, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is our hope,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.1. and hope it ſelf (I mean the grace of <hi>hope</hi>) is a comfortable bleſſing: ſo that the ſoul hath ſupportance in the very work of our being drawn to Jeſus Chriſt: and moreover, the Father addeth further comfort in his <hi>Juſtifying grace;</hi> for by it <hi>we have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5.1. and chap. 8.34. it is
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170568:115"/>
                  <hi>God that juſtifies, who ſhall condemn?</hi> ſuch gracious ſupports, and more then tranſient taſtings of his mercy; not ſuch as hypocrites may have, but ſuch as do more or leſs ſtay with the Saints, and people of God: ſo that at the leaſt, there doth ever remain a ſeed of <hi>conſolation</hi> in the hearts of all thoſe, whom God hath by his <hi>Spirit</hi> drawn home unto his Son.</p>
               <p>And when the <hi>Son</hi> receives the ſoul, he doth amplifie this comfort; he reveals the Fathers work unto the ſoul, Mat. 16.16, 17. <hi>Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-Jona, <hi>fleſh and bloud hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven:</hi> and Luk. 10.20. <hi>Rejoyce in this, becauſe your names are written in heaven.</hi> So that there is conſolation alſo in the work of the <hi>Son:</hi> but you ſhall finde it true, that it is by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> that both of them work, and that either of them comfort the ſoul, with thoſe beginnings of conſolation that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards break forth into more abundant riches of increaſe.</p>
               <p>But what doth the Holy Ghoſt do more?</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Anſwer; He doth bear witneſs with a more <hi>abundant meaſure</hi> of conſolation, Rom. 14.17. <hi>The kingdome of God is not meat, and drink; but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> He doth ſo clearly reveal our acceptance through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that from thence ſpringeth peace unto the ſoul, which groweth up until it paſſeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and bringeth us <hi>unto joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. therefore he is called by way of eminency, <hi>The Comforter;</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:170568:115"/>becauſe when he comes, he doth ſo <hi>clearly</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie unto you your righteouſneſs to be in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, The <hi>comfort</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, is more <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>abiding;</hi> as Chriſt (ſpeaking of the <hi>Comforter</hi>) promiſeth unto his Apoſtles, Joh. 16.22. <hi>I will ſee you again, and your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy ſhall no man take from you:</hi> not but that God may ſometimes eclipſe it, for the trial of his ſervants; yet ordinarily it is more <hi>conſtant,</hi> and leaveth faith even then more <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>firm,</hi> Nehem. 8.10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength:</hi> when the Holy Ghoſt taketh in hand to comfort his people, he doth abundantly <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> them with his <hi>conſolations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, As the comfort of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is more abundant, and conſtant, ſo it is more <hi>powerful;</hi> Luk. 24.49. <hi>Behold, I ſend unto you the promiſe of the Father: tarry ye at Jeruſalem, until you be endued with power from on high:</hi> ſo Act. 1.8. <hi>You ſhall receive power from on high, after that the holy Ghoſt is come upon you;</hi> not by the <hi>gift</hi> of him, nor by his <hi>inhabitation,</hi> nor by <hi>ſanctification,</hi> nor by <hi>revelation</hi> only; but in the <hi>power</hi> of all theſe, that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of ſtrong opppoſitions, you might have <hi>ſtrong conſolation:</hi> therefore this is the ground of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> thankſgiving, 2 Cor. 1.5. and chap. 2.14. <hi>For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us: ſo alſo our conſolation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth by Chriſt; and thanks be to God, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt.</hi> Thus you ſee the truth of the Point, that the work of <hi>conſolation</hi> doth in ſpecial manner belong
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170568:116"/>unto the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> yet for the further clearing of it, there is a Queſtion or two to be anſwered: There is mention made, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. of the <hi>ſeal</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of the <hi>earneſt</hi> of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> Therefore it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, 1. <hi>What is the ſeal of the Spirit.</hi> 2. <hi>What is the earneſt of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">1. Firſt, He doth <hi>confirm</hi> and ratifie all the gracious promiſes of God unto the ſoul, bearing witneſs in truth and power of them unto the ſoul, and thereby begetting and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170568:116"/>confirming faith in the ſoul: for the uſe of the <hi>ſeal</hi> is to <hi>confirm;</hi> and this is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal work of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to <hi>confirm</hi> all the promiſes of God as an authentick <hi>ſeal.</hi> There is a place of Scripture, which being a little miſs-tranſlated, leadeth (I cannot ſay into a little) but into a great inconveniency, Epheſ. 1.13. <hi>In whom after that ye believed, ye were ſealed: Calvin</hi> is much troubled about it, and ſo is <hi>Piſcator:</hi> the truth is, it implyeth thus much, that <hi>in believing they were ſealed;</hi> this is the true Engliſh of thoſe Greek words: ſo that it is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that comes in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry promiſe of grace wherein <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is conveyed unto the ſoul, &amp; he ſetteth it home, and confirmeth it to the ſoul, by begetting faith in that grace, and ſo <hi>ſetteth to his ſeal that it is true</hi> to thee: and hence it is, that the <hi>faith</hi> which is wrought by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>ſeal,</hi> Joh. 3.33. <hi>He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeal that God is true:</hi> ſo then, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſetteth his <hi>ſeal</hi> to it, when he gives us faith; and thus he is <hi>the ſeal,</hi> as he doth <hi>confirm</hi> all the word of Gods grace unto us: and hence it is that <hi>faith</hi> is called <hi>the ſpirit of faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Calvin</hi> diſputes this point at large, when he ſpeaketh touching the <hi>authority</hi> of the word of God; which though it be none of the moſt learned, nor elegant of his works; yet I think there be ſo many plain arguments, that they may convince the moſt arrogant <hi>Atheiſt:</hi> yet to make him believe it you cannot, except the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſet in to convince a gain-ſayer; for it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> that gives the <hi>ſeal</hi> and <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:170568:117"/>of every word of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeak a little more plainly in this point: although the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> (1 <hi>Epiſtle chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8.) ſpeaketh of ſix witneſſes, that bear witneſs unto Jeſus Chriſt; yet you ſhall finde this to be true, that there are none of all that do ſet it home unto the ſoul, but the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> only: when the <hi>Father</hi> beareth witneſs, he doth it by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. &amp;c. <hi>God revealeth the hidden things of his love unto us by his Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. when the <hi>Son</hi> doth ſhew us the <hi>Father,</hi> and ſo ſetteth the ſoul at liberty, and eaſeth our conſciences thereby, <hi>The Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty:</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17. And it is the Spirit that ſetteth on his own work much more plentifully by the powerfull effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of himſelf upon the ſoul, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.8. and for the <hi>water,</hi> and the <hi>bloud,</hi> who applyeth them? as for the <hi>water</hi> of ſanctification, it is but a creature, and it is not in the power of any creature to beget faith: for the <hi>word</hi> of God it ſelf cannot beget faith: can any work of God do it? no, no, it is neither the <hi>bloud</hi> of juſtification, nor the <hi>water</hi> of ſanctification that can beger faith, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> only: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you will ever and anon ſuſpect your faith, and your ſanctification; and every Chriſtian knows what <hi>I</hi> ſay, That if a man have nothing but his <hi>works of ſanctification</hi> to truſt unto, they will fail him, unleſs the Spirit of God do breathe in them, &amp; teſtifie the Lords acceptance of you: All the <hi>works of creation</hi> though they may convince my judgement that there is <hi>a God,</hi> yet they cannot beget
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170568:117"/>lively faith in me, unleſs <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſet in with them; for the <hi>word of God</hi> cannot do it, no nor the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> though they be ſeals: but when are they ſeals? only then when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is conveyed in them; and therefore we ſee why the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is called a <hi>ſeal,</hi> becauſe he doth confirm our faith in the works, and word of God.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, But may not a ſoul comfort himſelf, in the former <hi>experiences</hi> of Gods mercy?

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt</hi> that ever fell off from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> and what was the ground of it? he <hi>mocked Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 21.9, 10. what <hi>mocking</hi> was it? in regard of humane frailty? no, no; it was a plain <hi>perſecution,</hi> and that implies
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170568:124"/>ſuch a <hi>perſecution</hi> as was caſt upon him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Covenant of grace</hi> made with him; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Here is the child of promiſe!</hi> or the like, inſomuch that <hi>Sarah</hi> could not endure he ſhould tarry any longer in the houſe; for this was not <hi>humane frailty,</hi> but <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſolency</hi> againſt the Covenant; whereas happy he, if he might have fallen under the wing of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond</hi> that you read of, who <hi>fell</hi> from the <hi>Covenant,</hi> fell not upon thoſe terms; but the love of <hi>worldly ſenſual bleſſings</hi> did choak the affections of <hi>Eſau</hi> toward the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, which was the chief bleſſing of the firſt born in the days of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac;</hi> but he coming in hungry, ſelleth his <hi>birthright</hi> for a meſs of red pottage, Gen. 25.31. &amp;c. <hi>Thus Eſau deſpiſed his birthright:</hi> ſo this ſort of children deſpiſe the grace of God, not out of a malicious frame of ſpirit, but they are choaked with the <hi>cares of this world;</hi> and the beſt ſeed that was ſown in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unfruitful: and this is the caſe of all the good husbands of the world that deſpiſe the <hi>Covenant of grace;</hi> for when once a man is taken up with the profits and pleaſures of this life, he then cares not a ruſh for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: mount <hi>Sion</hi> is not now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for him, ſo prophanely do they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the Covenant of grace in compariſon of ſenſual luſts: and do men thus fall from the Covenant of grace, becauſe it is a duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the power of nature? no, no, the very common gifts they had, might have reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the one of theſe from <hi>mocking,</hi> and the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170568:125"/>other from <hi>ſelling his birthright</hi> for a meſs of pottage: it is evident that the children of Chriſtian Parents, when as they come to fall off from God, they do not fall upon ſuch things as they are not able to prevent: but either they <hi>ſcorn</hi> and <hi>perſecute</hi> the things of God, or elſe they prefer ſenſual luſts before them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>third way,</hi> whereby the children of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents <hi>fall</hi> from the Covenant of grace, is a <hi>ſelf-confident cleaving</hi> unto thoſe gifts of grace, which by the Covenant they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: beſides theſe cauſes of their falling from the Covenant of grace, I have obſerved no more in Scripture, nor have I found any more in mine own experience. When men are inveſted with many ſpiritual bleſſings; ſweetly indowed with many ſprinklings of the bloud of the Covenant, whereby they come to be great in <hi>knowledge,</hi> and ſometime excel in a <hi>ſpirit of prayer,</hi> and ſome are good at one thing, and ſome at another; and being full of ſuch <hi>gifts,</hi> it may eaſily come to paſs that they may grow ſo confident of theſe, that they will not ſubject themſelves unto the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus. And this was the rejection of the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 10.3. <hi>They being ignorant of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God:</hi> and hence the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace</hi> is unto them turned into a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works;</hi> they are now become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>bond-woman,</hi> and not the children of the <hi>free-woman:</hi> for they that have their
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170568:125"/>faith in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and not <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> they fall under <hi>a Covenant of works.</hi> So that (minde you) the Lord is juſt and righteous in all theſe his diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>I ſaid before, God did receive <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>ſeed</hi> into this Covenant: I mean the <hi>faithful ſeed;</hi> and they are received into the <hi>ſecond ſort</hi> of <hi>bleſſings</hi> of the Covenant, which are truly ſaving: for the Lord receives them into <hi>inward fellowſhip</hi> with his <hi>Son,</hi> ſo as that they ſhall be <hi>juſtified, ſanctified,</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi> But are the <hi>carnal ſeed</hi> then rejected? no, but they partake in many bounties of God, and grow up and live in his ſight; what? in the enjoyment of <hi>outward bleſſings</hi> only? no, of <hi>ſpiritual bleſſings</hi> alſo: I, but the Lord gives them not the ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>ſaving grace</hi> by the Covenant: doth he not? and why is it? not becauſe he doth not <hi>offer</hi> it to them: but becauſe they <hi>fall off</hi> from it upon ſuch terms, wherein there lay no <hi>neceſſity</hi> upon them, that they ſhould ſo fall off: <hi>Iſhamel</hi> needed not have mocked <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac; Eſau</hi> needed not have <hi>ſold</hi> his <hi>birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> for a meſs of pottage: never let them pretend the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>corrupt nature; corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> putteth no ſuch neceſſity upon us, to ſell away ſuch bleſſings upon ſuch terms. And for others that truſted in their <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> had not the Lord convinced them, that it was not their <hi>own righteouſneſs</hi> that could ſave them? did not <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>If thou Lord mark iniquity, Lord who ſhall ſtand?</hi> Pſal. 130.3. and <hi>in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified,</hi> Pſal. 143.2. ſo that, it is not the blindneſs of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170568:126"/>mans nature that excuſeth, but this flows from a <hi>malignant,</hi> and <hi>affected ſelf-confidence;</hi> therefore now they are juſtly diſinherited: for the <hi>Jewes</hi> were not rejected until it was made plain to them, that their <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> would not ſtand before the Lord; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, Act. 13.46. <hi>It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; but ſeeing you put it from you,</hi> &amp;c. and he had ſaid before, <hi>They contradicted and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> and why was it neceſſary that the word ſhould be ſpoken unto them? truly, that God might be <hi>faithful</hi> in his <hi>Covenant;</hi> for if all the children of Chriſtian Parents, may not have <hi>liberty</hi> in the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> then the Lord ſhould be wanting to his <hi>Covenant:</hi> ſo that if they be <hi>Jewes</hi> by nature, the Lord is bound by <hi>Covenant,</hi> that they ſhall not for want of means periſh; nor upon ſuch grounds as are far above the <hi>nature</hi> of creatures to reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: for though it be above the power of the creature to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> yet it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the power of <hi>nature</hi> to <hi>abſtain</hi> from <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs</hi> and <hi>malignity,</hi> and ſuch ſtrong <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> in their legal righteouſneſs; therefore doth he call them to <hi>Church-priviledges,</hi> and <hi>common gifts</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> things that are above the power of nature to reach unto: and he doth alſo <hi>preſerve</hi> them from many evils, and <hi>tenders</hi> unto them the <hi>ſure mercies of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> but if they will maligne it, and caſt it behind their backs, and chooſe other things before it; ſuch degenerate children of godly Parents, their <hi>bloud</hi> ſhall be upon their own heads.</p>

               <p>In the third place, ſeeing that, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> as the Lord <hi>receives</hi> the faithful <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> into the Covenant of his grace, and in like manner <hi>taketh</hi> not only <hi>you,</hi> but <hi>all of yours</hi> by vertue of the Covenant: and ſeeing that the Lord doth in giving himſelf, give us <hi>all his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Attributes, Ordinances, Providences;</hi> for he is the Lord of hoſts, and therefore <hi>all that is Gods is ours alſo:</hi> It will follow ſemblably, that we muſt be <hi>as God is,</hi> and our <hi>children</hi> as <hi>his children;</hi> and <hi>our ſervants</hi> as <hi>his ſervants;</hi> and our <hi>wits,</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> muſt all be <hi>for God,</hi> and not for our ſelves: moreover, all that is in our <hi>Churches</hi> is for God, Cant. 7. ult. <hi>At our gates are all manner of pleaſant fruits both new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from hence two things follow,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Here is a ground for <hi>family-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> for if all that I have muſt be the <hi>Lords</hi> (for he takes me as he gives himſelf) then it is for us to <hi>give up</hi> all our <hi>relations</hi> unto him, as much as lies in us: we can do nothing but <hi>ſet</hi> them <hi>before the Lord;</hi> but it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that we ſhould <hi>conſtrain</hi> them to duty, <hi>pray</hi> with our children and ſervants, <hi>teach</hi> them the will of God; <hi>reſtrain</hi> them from wickedneſs: <hi>I know Abraham,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>That he will command his children, and his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. 18.18. and the Lord commandeth Parents to bring up their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 6.4. we muſt therefore teach them
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170568:129"/>to <hi>know the God of their Fathers,</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>And thou Solomon my ſon, know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo old <hi>Lois</hi> and <hi>Eunice</hi> were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to train up <hi>Timothy</hi> in the knowledge of the Scriptures from a child: this the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us; as ever we look to have right in <hi>his Son,</hi> he will have right in <hi>our ſons:</hi> if we have right in <hi>his Spirit,</hi> he hath right in <hi>our ſpirit;</hi> if you have any right in <hi>his ſervants,</hi> he hath right in <hi>your ſervants:</hi> and therefore uſe the means to draw them home to him, and leave the bleſſing unto the Lord: but if <hi>Parents</hi> be <hi>watchleſs</hi> in conveying the <hi>bleſſing</hi> to their <hi>children,</hi> and <hi>children careleſs</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it; God is faithful, and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant faithful, though they fall ſhort of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, This alſo follows, that as God betruſteth us with any gifts, or parts, or talents; with <hi>honour, wealth, health, ſtrength, beauty, liberty,</hi> or what elſe ſoever: if the Lord have given us any bleſſing, it is wohlly his, for we muſt <hi>be unto God,</hi> as we would have him <hi>be unto us;</hi> and therefore the Lord took it unkindly from his people, Hoſ. 2.8. <hi>That the corne, and wine, and oyl, and ſilver, and gold, which he had given them, they prepared for Baal. Iſrael is an empty vine, when he bringeth forth fruit unto himſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 10.1. ſo likewiſe he taketh it ill, Ezek. 16.20, 21. that <hi>they took his ſons, and his daughters, and ſacrified them unto Moloch:</hi> ſo ſometimes men count it a gentile thing to train up their
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170568:129"/>children to <hi>idleneſs,</hi> and other <hi>vanities;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth it is as if they trained them up to <hi>Moloch:</hi> and this the Lord doth abhor, and will ſadly require it in his own time. If therefore we muſt give up our ſelves and ours unto God; then here is a foundation for <hi>family-duties,</hi> and alſo to <hi>improve our ſelves,</hi> and all that we have, wholly to advance the glory of the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt: elſe we pluck aſunder the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>4</label> If the Lord in this Covenant receive us to be a peculiar people unto himſelf, ſomething we are to learn in the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>performance</hi> of all holy <hi>duties;</hi> for as we are ſtill to be doing in the uſe of means to help our knowledge, and faith; ſo in all let us ſtill be expecting from the Lord to <hi>lay hold</hi> upon us and ours, and to <hi>receive us:</hi> for our hope ſtandeth more in Gods <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving us,</hi> then in our <hi>giving our ſelves</hi> unto him; reſt not therefore in all the good means that you uſe, for that will not hold unleſs the Lord be pleaſed to <hi>receive</hi> us, and ours. Joh. 6.37. <hi>All that the Father gives me, ſhall come unto me:</hi> ſo that unleſs the Lord <hi>give</hi> our children to his Son, though we devote them to him, it is a queſtion whether he will take them or no: look we up therefore unto the Lord, that he may take them graciouſly unto himſelf: the Prophet exhorteth <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 14.1, 2. But how ſhall they return? not unleſs the Lord <hi>take away their iniquity, and receive them graciouſly;</hi> and thus the Propher teacheth them to pray: ſo that they do not ſtand upon their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170568:130"/>nor look to this and that which they can do; no, no, <hi>take with you words, and ſay, Take thou away our iniquity;</hi> otherwiſe we ſhall never get it out: he alſo muſt <hi>receive us graciouſly, and ſo ſhall we render unto him our ſelves,</hi> and all that we can do. This is the way of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace; whatſoever duties the Lord requireth to be done on our parts, let us look unto him in all to receive us and ours, otherwiſe we and ours ſhall ſoon turn our backs upon God, and upon his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which he hath ſo graciouſly invited us unto in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We now come to the third and laſt Branch of the Doctrine;
<note place="margin">Third Branch of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> which is, That <hi>the Lord took the chief of Abrahams ſeed, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be the mediator and ſurety of the Covenant between God and Abraham:</hi> this is expreſſed, Gal. 3.16. <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made: he ſaith not, And to his ſeeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt:</hi> ſo that he is the chiefeſt of the ſeed with whom the <hi>Covenant</hi> is eſtabliſhed, as alſo the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> teſtifieth, chap. 42.6. and 49.8. <hi>I will give thee for a covenant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a light of the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh fully, when he ſaith, Heb. 8.6. that <hi>he is the mediator of a better covenant:</hi> and <hi>a ſurety of the Covenant.</hi> Heb. 7.22. Chriſt is therefore the chiefeſt of the ſeed, and the <hi>Mediatour</hi> and <hi>Surety</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now a Mediatour he is between both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; partly in reſpect of his <hi>perſon,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of his <hi>Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:170568:130"/>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of his perſon, as he is God and man, he is a <hi>fit perſon</hi> to be the ground of our <hi>union</hi> with God, and to maintain our <hi>communion</hi> with him: for what is a Mediator? but a middle perſon to bring two perſons, that are at difference into one? now Chriſt as he is God-man, is moſt fit for this work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, To be the ground of our <hi>Union:</hi> for being God-man, he hath united both the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering natures into one; ſo he is a middle perſon, and fit to be the <hi>foundation</hi> of our <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and therefore he is called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. <hi>That is, God with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, By his <hi>perſon</hi> he is fit to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> our <hi>communion;</hi> and there are two things requiſite unto that:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, The <hi>removal</hi> of all <hi>offences;</hi> and Chriſt is moſt fit for that: for as he is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on of <hi>man,</hi> he is moſt fit to <hi>ſuffer</hi> all puniſhment due unto ſin; and therefore as man <hi>he became ſin for us, that we might become the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. ult. And as he is <hi>God,</hi> ſo he is fit to <hi>overcome ſin,</hi> and to prevail againſt the <hi>wrath</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He is fit to <hi>communicate</hi> all the good things of God unto us: as <hi>God,</hi> he is fit to beſtow upon us all ſpiritual comforts, and heavenly gifts and bleſſings: as <hi>man,</hi> he knows what is moſt fit for the ſpirit of man, and ſo he is fit to <hi>communicate</hi> unto us all the good things of God: he hath <hi>ſuffered</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and hath been <hi>tempted,</hi> and ſo he is fit <hi>to ſuccour ſuch as are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2.17, 18. thus he is a <hi>fit Mediatour</hi> in regard of his <hi>Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:170568:131"/>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He is fit to be a <hi>Mediatour</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Offices;</hi> he is a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and a <hi>King;</hi> and in all theſe Offices he doth properly, and lively exerciſe the Office of a Mediatour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, As a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> He doth offer <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. even <hi>himſelf,</hi> Heb. 10.10. <hi>He gives his life a ranſom for many,</hi> Mat. 20.28. and he doth not only thus give all this, but <hi>apply</hi> it alſo unto us, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto a <hi>Mediator</hi> for to do. And as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he doth <hi>ſit at Gods right hand, and makes interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8.34. and <hi>if any man man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, which is Chriſt the righteous; by him God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth the world unto himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. thus <hi>he taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Joh. 1.29. and becomes <hi>a propitiation for us,</hi> Rom. 3.24, 25. theſe things he doth, as he is a <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, As he is a <hi>Prophet,</hi> he <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us all things,</hi> Acts 3.22. whatſoever things he hath done and ſuffered for us, thoſe things as a Prophet he teacheth us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>As a King,</hi> he doth <hi>apply</hi> all this grace unto us, <hi>ſubduing</hi> us by his Spirit unto himſelf, and all the <hi>creatures</hi> unto us. God by him as a <hi>Mediator,</hi> doth <hi>bring us on</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually <hi>unto himſelf,</hi> by the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Word and Spirit, and <hi>keepeth</hi> us with himſelf in ſpotleſs <hi>communion</hi> unto his heavenly kingdom Theſe <hi>Offices</hi> give him <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to do it, as alſo <hi>faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> according unto his tender compaſſion on our neceſſities. Thus we ſee
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170568:131"/>how the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is a <hi>Mediatour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In particular, he is a <hi>Mediatour</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> between God and us, and that in a threefold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe he is the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of the <hi>Covenant:</hi> thus he is called, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. he did firſt <hi>publiſh</hi> it unto our <hi>first Parents,</hi> Gen. 3.15. and unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by all the holy <hi>Prophets,</hi> and in the daies of his fleſh, and by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and their ſucceſſours, unto the end of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He is called the <hi>Mediatour</hi> of the Covenant, as he doth <hi>ratifie</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> by a threefold <hi>ſeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, By his <hi>bloud:</hi> for <hi>a Teſtament is confirmed by the death of him that made it,</hi> Heb. 9.15, 16, 17. he is the <hi>mediatour of the new teſtament, that by means of death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they which are called, might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> He made it <hi>ſure</hi> on <hi>Gods part,</hi> and on <hi>our parts</hi> he doth <hi>ſeal</hi> it up with his <hi>bloud,</hi> that it might be <hi>confirmed</hi> unto all Generations: and as no man altereth a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament after a Teſtatours <hi>death,</hi> ſo this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, As he hath <hi>confirmed it</hi> by his <hi>bloud,</hi> ſo alſo by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13, 14. &amp;c. 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit, whereby you are ſealed to the day of redemption:</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>Angel</hi> that aſcended out of the Eaſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>ſeal of the living God,</hi> Rev. 7.2, 3. And look as it was the manner of the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of old, to <hi>ſprinkle</hi> the <hi>bloud</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> upon the <hi>book of the law,</hi> and upon the <hi>people:</hi> ſo doth the Lord Jeſus <hi>beſprinkle us,</hi> and that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170568:132"/>
                  <hi>which is taught us,</hi> with his <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and thereby begetteth the experience of the ſavour of God in our hearts, and <hi>ſealeth</hi> it up unto us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, He doth <hi>ſeal</hi> it by the <hi>ſeals</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which are <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> ſo it is here ſaid, <hi>He gave him the covenant of circumciſion, which was a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith;</hi> inſtead whereof he hath given us <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And by the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> he <hi>ſealeth</hi> it; for that is <hi>the bloud of the new Teſtament,</hi> Mat 26.28. by all theſe means he doth <hi>confirm</hi> the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Dan. 7.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, He is not only the <hi>Publiſher,</hi> and <hi>confirmer,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of it; for you ſhall ſee that in all Covenants there are ſome that are <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> as we read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.22. where ſpeaking of the league between <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> he makes mention of the <hi>Princes of the Covenant.</hi> So in this reſpect the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is called the <hi>Covenant</hi> it ſelf: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.6.49, 8. as being the Head and Prince of it; and that implyeth two or three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, If he be the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> then all the Covenant is <hi>firſt made with him,</hi> Gal 3.16. <hi>To Abraham, and to his ſeed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto Chriſt:</hi> and to the <hi>Church</hi> his myſtical body in him, and under him; and therefore <hi>all the promiſes are in him yea, and in him amen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. that is to ſay, all the Promiſes, and all their conditions are fulfilled in him; as he ſaith, <hi>It behoveth us to fulfil all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Mat. 3.15.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:170568:132"/>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He doth <hi>inherit</hi> the <hi>bleſſings</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſo far as his bleſſed nature is capable of them; he hath received the crown of inheritance of all the bleſſings both of this life and of another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. he ſitteth at Gods right hand; having led captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he treadeth down Satan under his feet; therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, He hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> all the <hi>conditions</hi> of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> as this is one part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>The redeemer ſhall come out of Sion, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob;</hi> as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. expoundeth the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.20. for he <hi>fulfilleth</hi> in us all the conditions of the Covenant: he it is that <hi>turneth</hi> us to the Lord, and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to do all things in us and for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, He doth <hi>communicate</hi> the <hi>bleſſings</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> to us, having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf exactly fulfilled all the Conditions of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He doth <hi>apply</hi> the comfort of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> unto us; and having done all theſe things, he leadeth us ſtill to wait upon him for further and further bleſſings in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: Thus we have ſeen in particulars how the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Mediatour</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> He is the <hi>Publiſher</hi> of it, the <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> of it, by his <hi>bloud,</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> by the <hi>ſeals</hi> of the <hi>Covenant:</hi> he is the <hi>Prince</hi> of it, and hath received all the <hi>promiſes</hi> from God; they are accompliſhed in him, he hath <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> all the <hi>conditions,</hi> and <hi>received</hi> all the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> and <hi>applyed</hi> them unto us, and wrought all things in us, and for us, and ſtill leadeth

We do not <hi>depend</hi> upon their prayers, that by the <hi>merit of them</hi> they ſhould prevail: but we look at it only as <hi>a way,</hi> wherein the Lord calleth us to <hi>wait upon him:</hi> ſo as that when we have done deſiring, we look for all bleſſing from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> even then when we beg the prayers of our friends. When as God was angry with the friends of <hi>Job,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they falſly accuſed <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 42.7, 8. he bids them <hi>take a ſacrifice, and go to Job, and he ſhall pray for you; for him will I accept:</hi> but muſt they now truſt upon <hi>Job?</hi> or upon his acquaintance with God? no verily, but upon the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> who was held forth by the <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> So that though we crave the help of our brethrens prayers, yet the Lord doth not allow us, to make our friends <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours</hi> between Chriſt and us; we look not for any thing <hi>from them,</hi> but <hi>from the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>alone</hi> in that way.

But that we might the better underſtand the <hi>mystery of iniquity:</hi> do not they make the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> the <hi>Mediatours</hi> of their <hi>Redemption</hi> alſo? what is the ground of the <hi>Popiſh indulgences?</hi> have not they a <hi>treaſure of Church-merit</hi> which they boaſt of? and therefore have they power, as they ſay, to grant pardons, and to <hi>apply</hi> the

This may be a piece of <hi>refined Popery,</hi> but it is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> at the very bottom: if we look unto our <hi>graces,</hi> or <hi>duties,</hi> to bring us unto <hi>union</hi> with Chriſt; or if we think that by the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>them, communion</hi> ſhall be maintained, we have forgotten our <hi>Mediatour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> God and man; for if <hi>he</hi> be our <hi>Mediatour,</hi> he doth work both theſe for us: theſe things cannot <hi>bring</hi> us unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for they all <hi>flow</hi> from him; if
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170568:134"/>therefore we have no other <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then that which flows from <hi>them;</hi> we are not united unto this very day.

If they can <hi>uphold</hi> it, they are <hi>in part Mediatours:</hi> that they do <hi>uphold</hi> it by <hi>merit,</hi> no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> will ſay: neither is there any right, or power in them to do this; and therefore to truſt in them, is to put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the arm of fleſh: and though it be not ſo groſs as <hi>Popery,</hi> yet it tends unto the like diſhonour of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> and worthy of all acceptation, when they ſaw the people ready to attribute much unto their <hi>holineſs,</hi> Acts 3.12. &amp;c. <hi>Ye men of Iſrael,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) why look ye ſo earneſtly on us, as if we by our power, or holineſs, had made this man to walk? the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. ſo it is not in the power of the beſt ſpiritual gifts or works, to make a <hi>creeple go:</hi> much leſs is it in their power to make a <hi>feeble ſoul ſtand</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; but the God of our fathers glorifieth his Son Jeſus, in doing all this work for us; for he is our <hi>only mediatour</hi> of <hi>reconciliation, redemption,</hi> and <hi>interceſſion;</hi> and if we look for any ſuch vertue, power, or right in any other means under heaven, we deprive Chriſt of the <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Mediatour.</hi> There is an <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as I hear, ſtirring in our native Country, that though none of our works give us <hi>merit, right,</hi> or <hi>power</hi> to reach the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> yet they give us <hi>fitneſs.</hi> Now truly this is but an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh word;</hi> in <hi>Latine</hi> we call it <hi>congruity:</hi> and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170568:135"/>this the <hi>Papiſts</hi> come unto, that when they be driven hard unto it, they will acknowledge that we have no <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>condignity,</hi> but only <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>congruity:</hi> therefore in truth it is plain <hi>Popery</hi> in Engliſh: it is true indeed, there is a <hi>fitneſs,</hi> but it lies not in <hi>doing;</hi> it is <hi>ſuch a fitneſs,</hi> as whereby the ſoul judgeth it ſelf <hi>unworthy</hi> of any grace: and now the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being emptyed of it ſelf, is <hi>fit</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> mercy from God; it is now fit to receive all from Chriſt. Conſider therefore, I beſeech you, what kind of <hi>Uſe</hi> God calleth us to make of all <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>works</hi> of grace; do not think we cry down <hi>ſanctification,</hi> becauſe we do not put it into <hi>Chriſts Mediatourſhip,</hi> becauſe we do not <hi>ſhut</hi> Chriſt out of <hi>heaven,</hi> and out of his <hi>Office</hi> by it; for we give it <hi>his</hi> honour: if we give it this honour of <hi>mediation,</hi> we cannot come to God, but we muſt be united: you will ſay, We cannot be <hi>united,</hi> till by <hi>faith</hi> we have <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> Is <hi>faith</hi> then a <hi>Mediatur</hi> between Chriſt and us? can there be no <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we bring <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> with us? truly then we muſt have <hi>Mediatours</hi> to bring us unto Chriſt: but doth not the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> in all that be in Chriſt? true: but how comes a man by the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> of the Goſpel? Zach. 12.10. <hi>I will pour upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, a Spirit of grace, and ſupplication; and they ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, and mourn for him,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>looking</hi> is <hi>faith,</hi> and this <hi>mourning</hi> is <hi>repentance;</hi> thus Chriſt ſeeth us before we ſee him, and <hi>becauſe we are ſons, God hath ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170568:135"/>the ſpirit of ſons into our hearts:</hi> Gal. 4.6, 7. and hereby we come to ſee him, and more and more of him; and this, is the way of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: Firſt, We <hi>have him,</hi> and him <hi>drawing</hi> us, and <hi>fitting</hi> us by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby we come to <hi>ſee</hi> him; and then we <hi>mourn</hi> over him for all the wrong we have done him; this is that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> that flows from Chriſt, and then brings us unto him: if it flow not from him, but firſt brings us unto him, it is not the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> of Gods elect, nor that which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel holds forth: Firſt take Chriſt, and then you have all things in him.</p>
               <p>Again, As nothing can firſt <hi>bring</hi> us unto Chriſt: ſo neither will it be able to <hi>maintain</hi> our <hi>communion</hi> with him: for as he is the <hi>door;</hi> ſo he is the <hi>Surety</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he is the <hi>Publiſher,</hi> and <hi>Confirmer,</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and he <hi>receives</hi> and <hi>keeps</hi> all the <hi>bleſſings</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> for us.

               <p>In the third place, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> this is a ground of much <hi>ſtrength unto faith,</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> unto all the duties, and fruits of faith; that the Lord hath made ſuch a Covenant as this is; an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting covenant, ſtabliſhed upon better grounds, in the hands of a better mediatour;</hi> that is, ſo fit to <hi>bring</hi> us unto God, and to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain union</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> between God and us; to remove all offences, and quicken our ſpirits towards God: it is our ſtrength to reſt upon this rock of Iſrael; <hi>this is indeed eternal life,</hi> Joh. 17.3. when we can ſay to <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> We know you not, and to our <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> and all the <hi>duties</hi> of it, We know you not, in point of <hi>mediation:</hi> but <hi>Jeſus</hi> we know, and his <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>mediation</hi> we know: as for other things, bring them in their places; but if you bring them in point
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170568:136"/>of <hi>mediation,</hi> they will keep us from cloſing with Chriſt. Therefore ſuch as deſire to maintain and to ſee maintained firm and full <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> let the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus only</hi> be their <hi>Advocate,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> for it is he that worketh all our works for us, and in ſpecial this main work of making and maintaining <hi>peace</hi> for us: if then we reſt not on what we are or do, but look unto Chriſt for our acceptance, and know that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable without him; then do we not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe our gifts, and duties, but uſe them as fruits of Chriſts <hi>mediation:</hi> if we look at them as <hi>cauſes</hi> of our <hi>mediation,</hi> we do utterly evacuate the <hi>mediation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> neither can we <hi>continue</hi> in that ſtate, without the ſame hand of grace: for even the <hi>Angels</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (as is generally received) ſtand <hi>confirmed</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Christ:</hi> if therefore <hi>they</hi> could not ſtand firm were it not for <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> much leſs ſhall the ſinful ſons of men <hi>come</hi> unto <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>ſtand</hi> firm in <hi>communion</hi> with God by their beſt graces; but when you have done all, your <hi>union</hi> will be broken, if the Lord doth not both begin, and perfect it to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Yea, even then when you are full of all the power of the moſt High, and of all heavenly conſolation, it is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that maintaineth your <hi>union</hi> with himſelf: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let creatures know that they are creatures, and let them look at the <hi>gifts</hi> beſtowed upon them, and <hi>works</hi> done by them, as the way, which the Lord hath given them to walk in. Say not, We have all we look for, nor think we our ſelves fit to be accepted of God: it is a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170568:137"/>Popiſh deluſion; it is not all our endeavours or duties, that will <hi>maintain</hi> us in <hi>communion</hi> with God one hour to an end. Thus you ſee that all theſe things are as they are, you have done but your duty in them all, and but a piece of that neither, and you have neither <hi>power,</hi> nor <hi>right,</hi> nor <hi>fitneſs</hi> in your ſelves to ſtand in Gods ſight. In the mean while, this is a point of much <hi>conſolation,</hi> that the Lord hath laid up the <hi>promiſes</hi> in a ſafer hand then our own, ſo as that now there is no fear of breaking between God, and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his <hi>faithful ſeed,</hi> for the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to take us to be his people, and given <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>Mediatour</hi> of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> then he will ſee this Covenant maintained, and perfected, and all the <hi>bleſſings, promiſes,</hi> and <hi>treaſures</hi> of it accompliſhed to us from day to day: do but know him, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and it will be of effectual power to root out all the diffidence that is in us; <hi>look</hi> upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> on him; and yet neither can we <hi>bring</hi> our <hi>waiting</hi> unto him, but it is our part to be convinced of our own <hi>poverty,</hi> and <hi>inſufficiency;</hi> and then all our power, and help, and hope, is in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our fellowſhip with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> wait upon him, that he may carry an end the whole work of a <hi>Mediatour</hi> for you, and that he may never leave you, till you be ſettled in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor then neither: for even the <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven would not be ſteadfaſt, but that the Lord hath laid a ſure foundation in a <hi>middle perſon,</hi> that he might <hi>unite God</hi> and the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> together. There is comfort in knowing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170568:137"/>this, though we have but little experience of it, becauſe there is comfort laid up in it: therefore that we might not ravel out our time in vain, know we, that there is an <hi>Aliquid ultra,</hi> ſomething further to be ſought after, beſides what we have found in our ſelves: we ſometimes hear of <hi>conditional promiſes,</hi> but as the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> in other things, ſo in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he is the <hi>firſt and laſt condition:</hi> he doth <hi>first bring</hi> us unto God, and ſo to the <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and when we are <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, we cannot be active of our ſelves, nor keep our peace with God but through him: if you ſtay in any thing that you can do, you have forgotten that Chriſt is the <hi>last condition;</hi> you have no <hi>right</hi> unto the <hi>Covenant</hi> before you <hi>have him;</hi> you have <hi>no condition</hi> of the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> unleſs you <hi>have him.</hi> But when I have <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have I not now the <hi>condition</hi> in my ſelf? which the promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth? truly you have not, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>laſt condition,</hi> as well as the <hi>firſt;</hi> and if your <hi>right</hi> unto the <hi>promiſe</hi> be not maintained by him, you forfeit the promiſe, as ſoon as you lay hold of it: you muſt therefore look back again unto Chriſt, not only to <hi>give</hi> you the <hi>right</hi> unto the <hi>promiſe,</hi> but the <hi>accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it; otherwiſe you may ſtay many a ſeven years, if you look for it in your own works: though thou hadſt right in Chriſt, and fellowſhip with Chriſt, and ſhalt look for comfort from thine own duties, thou mayſt look till thine eyes fail, and not finde it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> in the <hi>Promiſes</hi> he gave you; the <hi>Yea,</hi> and he muſt be the <hi>Amen:</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:170568:138"/>therefore know, that in all the duties you perform, you muſt, as it were, be dreſſing a meal for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Luk.</hi> 17.7, 8, 9, 10. and he content to feed <hi>after him,</hi> and <hi>upon him,</hi> who is the <hi>beginner</hi> and <hi>maintainer</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> for us; and will perfect all the powerful bleſſings of it, <hi>in</hi> us and <hi>for</hi> us, in his own time.</p>
